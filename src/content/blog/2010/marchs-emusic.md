<p>To encourage me to write more, I thought I would try covering what I get from eMusic with my 30 credits each month. Most of the time they will be full albums, but in the months where there are a couple extra credits, there will be some partial albums. So, without further ado, my March eMusic purchases:</p>

<h3><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131211162743/http://www.emusic.com/album/-Black-Sands-MP3-Download/11861823.html">Black Sands</a> by Bonobo <small>12 Credits</small></h3>

<p>I have been a fan of Bonobo since I was introduced to him in a promo video for Songbird. His newest album is his most complete album so far, with sweeping sounds throughout.</p>

<h3><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131211162743/http://www.emusic.com/album/Ali-Farka-Touré-Toumani-Diabate-In-the-Heart-of-the-Moon-MP3-Download/11841976.html">In the Heart of the Moon</a> by Ali Farka Touré &amp; Toumani Diabate <small>12 Credits</small></h3>

<p>Grammy award winning album from the combo of Ali Farka Touré and Toumani Diabate. Just beatiful music, I picked this because I was seeing if eMusic had their new album (which they don’t yet), but I didn’t even have to preview this before getting it. I cannot imagine someone not enjoying this album.</p>

<h3><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131211162743/http://www.emusic.com/album/Washed-Out-Life-of-Leisure-MP3-Download/11606243.html">Life of Leisure</a> by Washed Out <small>6 Credits</small></h3>

<p>eMusic recommended this based on my Air France downloads, and this is in the same vein. If you like the Cut Copy, Air France, Hot Chip sound, you will likely dig this too.</p>
