<p>Before I go over my resolutions for the upcoming year, I thought I would revisit the ones from last year:</p>

<ul>

<li>Exercise more – Other than snow shoveling last year, I didn’t get much done.&nbsp; Not sure how it will work out with a kid coming soon, but it is still a good goal. – **Failed**, no excuses here just didn’t do it. The only “exercise” I did regularly was walking across campus twice a day.</li>

<li>Be a parent – Not just being a Dad, but baring extra responsibility to help Rebekah stay sane and have quality time with Will. – **Success**, Will was born March 16th and we have stayed relatively sane.</li>

<li>See 3 movies in the theater – **Success** (Watchmen, The Invention of Lying and Avatar)</li>

<li>Finish one novel a month (First I have to find a novel each month, but we shall see) – **Failed**, I did read about 8 but not one per month</li>

<li>Keep up my blog at a reasonable pace – Leaving out the end of the year lists, I had almost 100 posts through the year.&nbsp; I would like to keep up about that pace.&nbsp; Something that should help is: **Failed**, just not the time I used to have for writing</li>

<li>Album of the Week – Replacing the Pick of the Week will be an Album of the Week.&nbsp; Current or from the past, I will pick an album each week to recommend. **Failed**, I gave up about halfway though the year due to the annoyance of getting album covers for each post.</li>

<li>Write more about music – If the Top 10 Lists showed anything, my traffic goes up when I write about music, so I will work on writing more about music. **Success**, what I did write, it was mostly about music.</li>

</ul>

<p>For 2010, I have had some difficulty in thinking of resolutions. The first reason is that I have learned over the last 9 months that you cannot anticipate what your kid is going to do next. I hate to think of a resolution that seems reasonable now, but in a month is totally unreasonable do to a change in Will’s routine or&nbsp;behaviors. That being said, here is what I have:</p>

<ul>

<li>Better manage my personal budget – I am not terrible at it, but it is a place I can improve</li>

<li>Decide on a technology for my web site – I am close, I think</li>

<li>Create my new web site – I have to decide what content I want, how I want to present it and then actually implement it.</li>

<li>Write 4 posts on my site each month – Some weeks are tougher than others for posts, so monthly might be more attainable</li>

<li>Engage a new music genre – After getting crap about my top 25 list of the decade being too similar, I figured it was a good excuse to investigate a new genre to keep expanding my music tastes. I had some success with jazz last year, so I am open to suggestions.</li>

<li>Beat the Metroid Prime trilogy – This one is pretty iffy I think, but if it is the only game I play I might be able to do it.</li>

<li>Most Important: Be the best husband and dad I can be – Nothing specific here, just want to feel like I did the best I could for the year.</li>

</ul>
