<p>Just two months late, it was a world music kind of month!</p>

<h3><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131211115539/http://www.emusic.com/album/Ravi-Shankar-The-Man-And-His-Music-MP3-Download/11258184.html">A Man and His Music</a> by Ravi Shankar – <small>8 Credits</small></h3>

<p>The legend Ravi Shankar at his finest. A steal at only 8 credits, you get nearly over 2 hours of amazing music.</p>

<h3><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131211115539/http://www.emusic.com/album/Toumani-Diabate-Djelika-MP3-Download/11748847.html">Djelika</a> by Toumani Diabate – <small>8 Credits</small></h3>

<p>Just adding to the Toumani Diabate collection I have going. Once again, amazingly peaceful music that is complex but utterly listen-to-able.</p>

<p>Some nice chill electronic music that is great for getting work done too. Mostly ambient, so no standout track really, but the album is pretty good.</p>

<p>Adding some more world music to my collection, this time the long-necked lute from Turkey. Nice Middle-Eastern rhythms here and if you are into this sort of thing, you will enjoy it. Yeah, I know that is basically just an accurate statement, but I don’t care</p>
