<p>I have the new design and am implementing <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131211083615/http://www.neato.co.nz/ultimate-tag-warrior/">Ultimate Tag Warrior</a> instead of the built-in categories for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131211083615/http://www.wordpress.org/">WordPress</a>.  One of the reasons to do this is because I am interested in using the blogging client <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131211083615/http://ecto.kung-foo.tv/">ecto</a>.  It can save posts locally (useful for someone who happens to switch blogging platforms more frequently than he should), edit posts without a browser and ties in nicely with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131211083615/http://www.opencommunity.co.uk/vienna2.php">Vienna</a>, by RSS reader of choice.  Ecto can be configured to also manage the tags for posts but it takes a little configuration.  Once I get that setup, I will be in blogging heaven, and will hopefully be posting more often as well.</p>

<p>Also, I have my new design in place if you want to check that out.</p>
