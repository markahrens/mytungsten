<p>In addition to the Iowa game this weekend, I got a new toy that I have been tinkering with as well.&nbsp; I have a nice new Canon Digital Rebel XT camera.&nbsp; I have wanted a digital SLR for awhile now and with the prices coming down for them, it worked out nicely.&nbsp; This is not the top of the line from the Rebel series, but it will work for my first DSLR.&nbsp; I am just starting to get the hang of things, but you can see my first pictures up on Flickr now.&nbsp; Here is one of the first shots I took at my dadâ€™s house</p>
