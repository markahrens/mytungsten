We are to the top 5 this week and starting us off is Radiohead’s **In Rainbows**.  This album is another strong effort from Radiohead, however it doesn’t really break any new ground from them which prevents them from being higher on the list.  It is a testament to Radiohead though that by doing the “same old” stuff, they can make the top 5 of my list.

There are some good songs and some great songs on the album.  A personal favorite is All I Need which takes sounds similar to early Plaid.  House of Cards is also a stellar work keeping the basic guitar riff throughout the entire song.  This is impressive as the song changes throughout, yet the riff works the entire time.  Overall, this is an impressive piece of work.
