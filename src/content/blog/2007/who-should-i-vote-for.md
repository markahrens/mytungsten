<td class="ta-r" style="padding:2px 0px 2px 0px;width:60px;height:60px;"><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131211172927/http://www.politicalbase.com/people/chris-dodd/2422/"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20131211172927im_/http://image.politicalbase.com/uploads/people/3000/2422/71502crhiss_dodd_150.jpg" style="border:solid 1px #CCC;"></a></td>

<td style="padding:2px 2px 2px 16px;">

		<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131211172927/http://www.politicalbase.com/people/chris-dodd/2422/" class="f-24 strong">Chris Dodd</a><span class="f-24 green"> – 70 match</span><br><br>

		Dodd is a liberal democrat who consistently receives somewhere between a 95-100% approval rating from Americans for Democratic Action and the National Committee for an Effective Congress. Unlike his Democrat counterparts, he believes that same-sex marriage and civil unions should be an issue left to states and supports free trade agreements. As a legislator, he is known for his work on expanding health care coverage to the uninsured, particularly children.

		<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131211172927/http://www.politicalbase.com/people/barack-obama/3221/" class="f-24 strong">Barack Obama</a><span class="f-24 green"> – 70 match</span><br><br>

		You must be ambitious and idealistic, like Barak Obama. Obama is a liberal democrat who, unlike his rivals, opposed the Iraq war from the start. With only 8 years in the Senate, his inexperience worries some and sometimes reveals itself in the debates, but he also has the charisma and popular support that the others lack.

		You’re looking for a moderate Democrat like Bill Richardson. Experienced in state, national, and international politics, Richardson has been a Congressman, an ambassador to the United Nations Security Council, and is now the governor of New Mexico. He is pro-choice, strongly favors rights for the LGBT population, advocates for affirmative action in government contracts, and even championed the idea that Congress should revoke the original authority it gave to go to war with Iraq. Richardson also supports the death penalty and gun ownership rights.
