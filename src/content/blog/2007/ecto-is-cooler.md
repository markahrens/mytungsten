Thanks to the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131211083615/http://blog.circlesixdesign.com/download/utw-rpc-autotag/">UTW-RPC</a> plug-in, it appears that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131211083615/http://ecto.kung-foo.tv/">Ecto</a> is able to add tags to my blog.  This makes Ecto a useable program for me to blog from.  I might try out the new version of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131211083615/http://www.flock.com/">Flock</a>, although maybe not.  It is getting better reviews, so I will likely give it a whirl and let everyone know if it is worth checking out.
