<p>I have gotten WordPress installed now and downloaded a theme so it doesnâ€™t look so blah while I work on a new one.  I figure this will buy me some time to get a new design up and running.  Also, I am looking for suggestions on a new RSS reader and a blog post editor on the Mac.  I am considering paying for one or both of these, so I am open to all suggestions.  Finally, I did move over the post from earlier today because there were some nice comments on there, so check those out too.</p>
