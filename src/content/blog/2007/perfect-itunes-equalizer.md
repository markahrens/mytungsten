<p>This has been around for awhile, but I finally got around to testing it and have to agree that this does make music even more enjoyable. &nbsp;The link is courtesy of&nbsp;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131211172927/http://www.macosxhints.com/article.php?story=20040902070807431">MacOSXHints</a>. &nbsp;If you use iTunes (and if you arnâ€™t, why not?) I would recommend setting this up.</p>
