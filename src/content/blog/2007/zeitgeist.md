<p>iTunes has announced the pre-sale of the upcoming Smashing Pumpkins album.  As many of you know, I am quite the Smashing Pumpkins fan, so I clicked Pre-Order Now last night.  So far I have been impressed with the Tarantula single and am anxious to hear the full album.</p>

<p>Along the lines of music, I have been working through my Not Listened To playlist on my iPod.   When Rebekah and I merged our iTunes libraries last year (now almost 60GB strong) I had made a playlist, descriptively called Mark, of the music I want on my iPod along with a smart playlist that had all of the music from Mark that had a playcount of zero.  However, I found myself listening to the same stuff over and over, so now I just sync the Not Played stuff to force myself to listen to everything at least once in alphabetical order by Artist.  This has actually been nice because I am getting to listen to some stuff that is good but I forgot about (Blur, I am looking at you).   I still have about 10 GB to go, but that is down from 13 GB.</p>
