As the year progresses, I realized that I have listened to more music that actually came out in the current year than in the last 5 years.  Because of this, I am feeling somewhat compelled to do a top 5 or 10 list at the end of the year.  Since that is still a couple of months away, I wanted to get help from the world to make sure that I did not miss any good albums that I should check out.  To help out, here is a list of albums I have listened to:

<ul>

<li>All of A Sudden I Miss Everyone – Explosions in the Sky</li>

<li>Andorra – Caribou</li>

<li>Autumn of the Seraphs – Pinback</li>

<li>Beyond the Neighbourhood – Athlete</li>

<li>Boxer – The National</li>

<li>Cease to Begin – Band of Horses</li>

<li>Chase This Light – Jimmy Eat World</li>

<li>Echoes, Silence, Patience &amp; Grace – Foo Fighters</li>

<li>Minutes to Midnight – Linkin Park</li>

<li>Neon Bible – Arcade Fire</li>

<li>A Night at the Ritz – Office</li>

<li>Planet of Ice – Minus the Bear</li>

<li>Some Loud Thunder – Clap Your Hands Say Yeah</li>

<li>The Stage Names – Okkervil River</li>

<li>A Weekend in the City – Bloc Party</li>

<li>Wincing the Night Away – The Shins</li>

<li>Year Zero – Nine Inch Nails</li>

<li>Zeitgeist – The Smashing Pumpkins</li>

</ul>

Please add your recommendations in the comments and near the end of the year you will see my top albums.
