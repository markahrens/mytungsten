The WordPress blog should be back reasonably soon so I have been holding off on posting, however today something bugged me enough to post. I hate when people flag e-mails they send as high priority. As the recipient of an e-mail, I decide how important the e-mail is, not the person who sends it. Things marked as a high priority usually are not and I have never had someone come up to me after I havn’t responded in a couple days with “Hey, I sent you that high priority e-mail, why didn’t you respond right away, ” so why bother using it.
