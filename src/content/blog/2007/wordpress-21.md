<p>Ever the quick converter, I upgraded to WordPress 2.1 within 3 hours of it being released.  The upgrade was a piece of cake.  Just bopping around the admin panel, it is definitely speedier and makes a few little changes that I like (no default category checked for me).  All of this comes along as I am evaluating my web site as a whole.  First, I have my new comics section, which I love.  Next, I have a new big project coming up that is going to either need a second WordPress install or some way to incorporating it into this site.  Basically I have more content coming soon and I have to decide if WordPress is the right choice for me still.  I am open to thoughts about the best way to manage static content with some sort of content management system or if anyone has done it with WordPress successfully.</p>
