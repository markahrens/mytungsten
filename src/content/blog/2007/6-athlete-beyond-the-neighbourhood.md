So this is the only album that I could see people having a beef with, however I don’t care.  It is my list, make your own list if you don’t like mine.  The album flows well and the music on it is wonderful.  It has the nice combination of pop and indie rock that just works and while the lyrics are not always the most complex, they work throughout the album</p>

<p>An example of this is *Hurricane*, no the song isn’t profound but the lyrics and music come together to make a great song.  Another good thing about the album is the variety in styles shown through the album.  *Airport Disco* and *Tokyo* normally wouldn’t sound like they belong on the same album, but they work perfectly here.  If you have any appeal to British rock, you owe it to yourself to check out this album. </p>
