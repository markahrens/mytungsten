<p>Tonight our friend Ken took Rebekah and I up in his plane to take some pictures of the Iowa City area from the air. It was a beautiful night and a neat experience for both of us as we had never been in a small plane like that before. We were up for about 45 minutes and got to see all sorts of stuff, some of which I took pictures of. The pictures are collected at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131211073649/http://www.flickr.com/photos/mizidymizark/sets/72157601682292290/">http://www.flickr.com/photos/mizidymizark/sets/72157601682292290/</a>. I can’t wait to go up again and in the future hopefully with a better camera to get even cooler shots.</p>
