As I work through my unplayed music (just about 5 GB left) I got to the letter N and the band <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131211083615/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nirvana_%28band%29">Nirvana</a>.  I have been a fan since my high school days and each time I come back to them, I am reminded how talented and awesome Nirvana was.  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131211083615/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dave_Grohl">Dave Grohl</a> is still doing rather well for himself and I am reminded that it actually is a tragedy that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131211083615/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurt_cobain">Kurt Cobain</a> blew his brains out.  I understand that music goes in trends and I donâ€™t know that if Kurt Cobain had lived that the state of music would be any better now, but I know that it would not have been any worse and for that, I get bummed out.
