<p>It is kinda funny that this was posted on Lifehacker today.  This afternoon I got interested in using some of the iTunes Smart Playlist features due to an article about a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131211130935/http://www.codepoetry.net/archives/2005/01/15/doityourself_smart_radio_station.php">Do-It-Yourself Smart Radio Station</a>, so I decided to check out some automatic rating programs.  They didnâ€™t really work, which sucks when there are over 10,000 tracks to rate.  So now I am stuck back with unrated songs and am not sure what to do, if anything, with ratings.  I am open to suggestions about how you use ratings or if you use them at all.</p>
