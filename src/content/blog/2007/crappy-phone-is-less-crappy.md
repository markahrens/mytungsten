<p>I don’t like my cell phone that much, a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131211083615/http://www.motorola.com/motoinfo/product/details.jsp?globalObjectId=56" title="Motorola v220">Motorola v220</a>, however I have another year of it due to contract stuff.  One of the things I hate is the address book.  It is a pain to enter phone numbers in it and I can’t categorize them well.  The phone is also a couple of years old and when I got it, I had a bear of a time trying to sync it with my Windows laptop.  I have had my MacBook for almost a year now and didn’t think to check Apple’s site to see if the v220 works with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131211083615/http://www.apple.com/macosx/features/isync/" title="iSync">iSync</a> before today.  Much to my pleasure, it does work with iSync!  Now I can sync with the iMac at home and have lots and lots of phone numbers I am missing on my cell phone.  Kudos to you Apple, my cell phone is just a little less miserable.</p>
