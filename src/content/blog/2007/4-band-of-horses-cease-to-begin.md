This album would have actually been higher on the list if it had been longer than 35 minutes.  That being said, this is the most complete 35 minute album I have ever listened to.  Every song hits perfectly and the variety of styles is fantastic.  You have the anthem-like start off with *Is There a Ghost* moving to the indie-pop sound of *No Ones Gonna Love You* to the subdued *Detlef Schrempf* and even the twangy sound of *The General Specific*.  They are all great, all of them.  If you have not listened to the album, you owe it to yourself to check it out, it might be the best half hour of your day.</p>
