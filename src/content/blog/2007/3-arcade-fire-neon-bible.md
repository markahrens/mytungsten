Following up on Funeral was going to be difficult for Arcade Fire, however they proved to be up to the challenge with Neon Bible.  Somehow darker than Funeral, Neon Bible resonates with the sound of failed goals.  No song emphasizes this more than Intervention, which also happens to be one of the top songs on the album.  In addition to the lyrics on the song, the organ work blends with a depressing beauty to make a near perfect song.</p>

<p>While Intervention is one of the top songs, there are also highlights with Keep the Car Running and No Cars Go.  This is not to say the rest of the album is bad, it just happens that there are some peaks on the album that stand out above the rest.  All of that being said, I am going to stop here because with the critical acclaim this album has received, I probably don’t need to add more.</p>
