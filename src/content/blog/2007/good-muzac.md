<p>With the new house, Rebekah and I will inevitably have guests over for dinner and whatnot.&nbsp; Our living room/dining area, we have a nice setup for music with our Bose Sounddock filling the room without taking up a ton of space.&nbsp; It really is ideal for the situation, however the issue comes with what music to play, so I am looking for recommendations.&nbsp; Typically I just want something in the background to supplement the discussion, so something without lyrics seems to work well.&nbsp; I also want something kind of mellow, but interesting.&nbsp; The best example I have of an artist would be Bonobo, but I am open to other ideas as well.&nbsp; So I appeal to the Internet to help me find new music to share with friends or just to listen to when chilling out at home.</p>
