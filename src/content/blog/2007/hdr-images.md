Yesterday, after listening to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131211083615/http://www.twit.tv/mbw">Macbreak Weekly</a>, I was introduced to the concept of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131211083615/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_dynamic_range_imaging">HDR images</a>. Some of the examples on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131211083615/http://www.flickr.com/groups/hdr/">Flickr</a> are really cool (some are a bit overdone as well, but that is to be expected). In any case, I decided to try the demo of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131211083615/http://www.hdrsoft.com/">Photomatix</a> with some pictures I took of the storms last night. Here is an example of what HDR can do.

This was done taking the same picture at 5 different exposures and using Photomatix to convert them. It took about 5 minutes to do and is a very rough example of what can be done. In any case, it is something I am going to try tinkering with more in the future and a very good excuse to get a tripod.
