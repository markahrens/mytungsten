In a wrap up of my RSS reader over the last two days, it is my understanding that these events are going to happen:

<blockquote>LOS ANGELES, Ca (AP) – Due to David Beckham’s injury, Harry Potter will be replacing him as the LA Galaxy face off against the English club, Chelsea.  Potter was chosen due to his popularity and the fact that he has an iPhone.  Why an iPhone was needed, no one knows, however it was agreed by LA Galaxy GM Alexi Lalas that it was very important.  Lalas said that his first choice was actually Michael Vick for the replacement, however Vick had prior obligations.</blockquote>
