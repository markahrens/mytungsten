<p>From <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131211095307/http://www.twit.tv/mbw">Macbreak Weekly</a>, one of their picks was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131211095307/http://www.magnatune.com/">Magnatune</a>.  Magnatune is a music distribution group that sells and licenses music for really inexpensive prices.  They also have podcasts of different genres that are an hour long and commercial free.  Since I am always looking for new music, this seems like a great avenue.  I have subscribed to the following podcasts to start out:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131211095307/http://www.magnatune.com/podcasts/ambient">Ambient</a></li>

<li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131211095307/http://www.magnatune.com/podcasts/idm">IDM</a></li>

<li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131211095307/http://www.magnatune.com/podcasts/indian">Indian</a></li>

<li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131211095307/http://www.magnatune.com/podcasts/middle-eastern">Middle-Eastern</a></li>

<li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131211095307/http://www.magnatune.com/podcasts/new_age_piano">New Age Piano</a></li>

<li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131211095307/http://www.magnatune.com/podcasts/relaxing">Relaxing</a></li>

</ul>

<p>So far I have listened to the Middle-Eastern and Indian ones, with the Indian one being kind of disappointing but the Middle-Eastern one being very good.  If you are looking for new music, I recommend checking out Magnatune.</p>
