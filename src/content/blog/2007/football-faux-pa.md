<p>I have really gotten into soccer over the last year, so much so that I watched most of a Chicago Fire match last weekend that had no offense at all in it (other than the lack of quality play from both teams).  While watching all this soccer, I have gotten interested in other leagues, specifically the MLS (kinda) and Serie A in Italy (it got picked up by FSC for this season).  Is it wrong to cheer for teams in other leagues?  I am a big Everton fan, but some other teams are fun to watch in other leagues so is it bad to cheer for them as long as they are not playing Everton?  I am open to thoughts on this because soccer is not quite the distinction of different sports in the US, but also isnâ€™t quite like cheering for two teams in the same sport.  In any case, what do you think?</p>
