<p>I mowed the lawn for our house the first time this evening and discovered that it takes about 30-45 minutes to mow.  I also found out that having a large yard is a good thing most of the time, but a bit of a bear when mowing it.  It doesnâ€™t help that the majority of the backyard is in bad shape for a lawn and is basically like trying to mow an off-road course.  All of that being said, it is kind of neat to do some of this home owner stuff.</p>
