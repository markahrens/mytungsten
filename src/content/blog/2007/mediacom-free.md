<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131211083615/http://www.urbanfarmgirl.net/">Rebekah</a> and I are officially <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131211083615/http://www.mediacomcc.com/">Mediacom</a> free now after I returned the equipment in preparation for the big move tomorrow.  The apartment is packed up and the only really bugaboo is the oven not wanting to come clean.  Other than that, we are ready to move into our first house tomorrow.  And if you thought the day couldn’t get any better for me, I did see a man with a hat with the phrase “This is My Gun Cleaning Hat” on it.  It is definitely a good day.
