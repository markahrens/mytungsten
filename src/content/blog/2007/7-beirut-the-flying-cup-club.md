By far the most unique but good album I have heard all year, Beirut’s use of dramatic vocals with accordion work stands out.  There is a decidedly European influence on the entire album, samples from French movies and the near wailing singing on some tracks, however Beirut brings it all together to make it work.  Every song on the album is a mix of sounds that sounds wonderful.</p>

<p>If you need specific songs to try, you can start with the second track, *Nantes* and *In the Mausoleum*.  The only real drawback to the album is that it is a bit short, which is only disappointing because it means the album is over so soon.</p>
