I havn’t posted much recently because I had to reload my mac and havn’t reinstalled ecto yet and I have been too lazy to go to the web interface to post.&nbsp; That is in conjunction with having about a billion things going on with the house, the kitten and softball over the last two weeks.&nbsp; That being said, I have a few comments about stuff that has happened and is noteworthy.

<ul>

<li>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131211073649/http://www.premierleague.com/">EPL</a> started, besides Iowa football games, Saturday mornings are up for some debate as to start with college football or soccer now.&nbsp; Also, Everton won, so that is a bonus.</li>

<li>The new <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131211073649/http://www.apple.com/ilife/">iLife</a> is cool.&nbsp; Rebekah and I are getting used to the new Events thing in iPhoto, but we think we like it.&nbsp; We havn’t given iWeb a look yet, but we think it holds promise for some family sites we have.</li>

<li>Gas weed-wackers are tough on the arms if you are not used to them.</li>

<li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131211073649/http://www.usanetwork.com/series/the4400/">The 4400</a> continues to be one of the best shows that few people know about.&nbsp; If you like Heroes, then you owe it to yourself to get all of The 4400 and watch it.</li>

<li>It hasn’t been cloudy all weekend and has been very hot.&nbsp; With hours before a great meteor shower, it is cloudy.</li>

<li>54 holes of golf in 48 hours is always a good thing.</li>

</ul>

That kind of sums up the last couple of weeks.&nbsp; Posts will come faster now that my mac is up and going again and I am feeling motivated to post.
