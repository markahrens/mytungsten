After 12 hours of hoops yesterday, then a couple hours of Metroid Prime, then waking up this morning and nearly beating Prime, I was ready for some more hoops this morning. Eleven rolled around and I get to start with Charlotte vs. NC St., but then I am quickly informed that I will be switched to a different game starting in a few minutes. To my dismay, it is the Minnesota/ISU game. Normally this would be OK, I can deal with watching Minnesota and ISU, but then comes the kicker, Billy Packer is commentating the game. Within the first few minutes, Packer is screaming about a travel and almost accusing him of cheating. Therefore, I am going to go to HyVee and get some food for the day and be content in not having to listen to Billy Packer.
