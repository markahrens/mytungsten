I would say that Courtney Scott leaving Iowa foreshadowed the trouble that the basketball program would have over the next 4 years. For those of you who don’t remember, Courtney Scott left Iowa during the peak of Iowa basketball’s recent fame, right as Iowa was breaking into the Top 10 with Recker and Evans. At the time it looked like Scott was frustrated by the playing time of Evans by saying that Alford played favorites with the team. Scott transferred to Oakland University and not many people have heard from him since. I paid attention to Oakland when we played them in the Hawkeye Challenge last year and saw Scott play for Oakland against Illinois this year. He developed well and is now a key member of their team. I then saw the highlights this week that Oakland, as a 12-18 team, won their league tournament and will be playing in the NCAAs. This means that since the year after Scott left, Alford has gotten to zero NCAAs and Scott is now in one. If only we had paid more attention to Courtney when he left.
