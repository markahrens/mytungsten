The new album from Moby doesn’t make too many strides forward from his last 2 CDs. It seems that he has gotten a bit content with his style and will just keep making the same sort of stuff. For fans, this is OK, but I would still like to see a little more progress. This isn’t to say that there is no good music, my particular favorites are Beautiful, Spiders and Slipping Away. There are other songs that do make me scratch my head though, almost like he was called by someone begging to be put into a song and with a sigh, Moby said fine. Both Temptation and I Like It feel a bit forced and their sound reflects it. Overall this isn’t a bad album, but it is really just more of the same.
