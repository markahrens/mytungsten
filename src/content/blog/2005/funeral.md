I decided to take Derrick’s advice once again and try out Funeral by Arcade Fire, as you may have seen if you have ever looked at my [Audioscrobbler Profile](https://www.last.fm/user/mizidymizark). Luckily this album has a better result than the Modest Mouse fiasco (FYI, that album still hasn’t grown on me). This is a nice rock album that takes some musical cues from bands like Talking Heads and David Bowie and puts a modern spin on them. Like most of the albums I get, I would recommend listening to the whole album and not single songs. However, if you must take one or two songs, I would recommend Neighborhood #1 (Tunnels), the first track on the album and Neighborhood #3 (Power Out), the fourth track. Both of these are good examples of the harder rock and would probably cader to more of the audience.

Booya Kasha! Listening to the D meister has finally paid. Oh yeah. Now only if we could take another step further and institute immediate pay raises. C’mon you wonderful manager you :)

Nice song choices. Since you mentioned Modest Mouse, I will, too: This album is going to leapfrog over MM when it hops into my revised 2004 top ten. Too bad you bought it on iTunes–the packaging is pretty cool. The lyrics and album info are printed inside a funeral program! Maybe that’s a bit too clever…
