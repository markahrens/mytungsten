The Futureheads have an interesting sound. You can almost instantly hear their 80â€™s New Wave influence but after listening to the album a couple of times through, you start to hear the more modern sounds throughout that make this such a good album. There are influences from indie and garage rock mixed in with the New Wave sound, making this a unique, but well done album. I am anxious to see what their next album will sound like and this left me wanting for more.
