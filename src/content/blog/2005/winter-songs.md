This is more of an EP than a full album and while it doesn’t really break any new ground, it is a nice quiet album. These 7 songs were bought on a pure whim without ever hearing of Matt Pond PA and I was pleasantly surprised by the soothing sounds on the EP. There is a nice cover of Holiday Road as well, which is even more corny since I live on Holiday Road right now. Overall, I can’t think of a better word than “nice” to describe these songs. There is nothing great about them, but they are easy to listen to as well.
