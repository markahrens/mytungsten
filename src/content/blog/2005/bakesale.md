I was looking for some unique rock when I purchased this album and I did happen upon some unique stuff with Sebadoh. I had never heard of the band, so I decided to use AllMusic.com to find some related artists to stuff I do like and they came up. Sebadoh mixes a quiet but hard (I know that doesn’t sound right, but it is accurate) rock with powerful lyrics to produce a nice album for the mid 90s. I was a little shocked at the use of profanity throughout a few of the early songs, something that was not commonly done at the time this came out. Songs like Magnet’s Coil use profanity to catch your attention in the middle of an otherwise ordinary indie rock song. I enjoyed this album, but I don’t know that I will rush out to pick up any of their other works.

Funny, I never noticed any profanity on that album. Obviously haven’t listened closely enough, but then again, I think I mostly listened to the guitar sounds anyway.
