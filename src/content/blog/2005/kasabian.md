The hype machine is turned way up here as the British fad comes to iTunes and the US. Actually I am just making that up, I have no idea how well the album did here or how much it was really hyped. I do know that the album is rock solid though. I donâ€™t know that I would go so far to say that this is the new sound of rock, but if it is, I would be OK with that as well. This is a well put together album that sounds good, but also shows the potential for growth as well. This is an album that you can put in and 45 minutes later feel quite satisfied. While there are good individual tracks, I personally recommend listening to the whole album through.
