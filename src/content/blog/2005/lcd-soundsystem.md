This is a double album on iTunes with the first CD being all new work and the second CD being a compilation of assorted earlier releases. I have heard a couple of the songs on the second CD, but it is nice to have that to see the evolution of the work. The second CD has some more “unfinished” sounding songs on it, but it is still worth the listen.

The real work to review here is the first CD, the all new work by LCD Soundsystem. Right from the beginning you get a sense of what the rest of the CD will be like. Daft Punk is Playing At My House is a catchy song that will get your head moving without even noticing it. The CD moves on from there, but it does not stray too far from the poppy, electronic sound. My personal favorite is Tribuations, it has a great beat that drives the entire song. Overall I think this 2 CD set is worth the 12 bucks on iTunes, partially because of the new work, but also because of the total collection.

it is kinda catchy though overly hyped in my not so humble opinion.

The second CD feels a little cluttered and don’t flow terribly well, it is good though. I would recommend the Arcade Fire’s Funeral if you like this type of alternative musak
