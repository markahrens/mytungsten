Well, according to reports coming in from around the state, Pierre Pierce is an idiot. Whether or not the aligations are true, to be Pierre Pierce and put yourself in a situation where you can be accused of these crimes makes you an idiot. I sat back and quietly defended the program, Alford and to an extent Pierce for a long time. I just give up now, until Alford and Pierce are off the team I cannot cheer for this team. Isn’t there some way that we can bring Ferentz in as the basketball coach?
