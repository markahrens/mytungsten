I want to write a lot more because I am really pissed, but at the same time I am tired and not that interested in ranting. The bottom line is that my apartment was broken into today. My new LCD, PS2, Gamecube and all games were stolen. Luckily my TV, DVDs, CDs, CD player and ReplayTV are still around, but needless to say, this is a bit of an annoyance. I do have renterâ€™s insurance, so I should be getting money back to get some of the stuff back, but this is not so hot for piece of mind. Anyways, when I have more or feel like writing more, I will.
