I used to mock people who listened to The Cure, thinking they were depressed all the time and were somewhat anti-social. After listening to this album, I don’t think this music had anything to do with the people who were anti-social, those people were that way anyways. This album has a wide variety of sound to it and while a couple of the more popular songs can sound depressing, overall this album is upbeat and well produced. If you are a fan of 80s music, you most likely have this album already, however if you don’t own it, you owe it to yourself to pick it up.
