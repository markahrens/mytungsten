This album is an interesting mix of electronic and eclectic rock sounds. It keeps on pace for the entire album with soothing rhythms with random guitar sounds in the background. This being said, there are definately some songs that are better than others. This is most noticeable with the songs Teen Angst going into Canâ€™t Stop, with Teen Angst being much better than the later. If you are into bands like My Bloody Valentine, you will probably enjoy this album as M83 is obviously influenced by them.
