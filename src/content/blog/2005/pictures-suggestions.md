As many of you have seen, I host my pictures locally on MyTungsten using the Coppermine Gallery software. This is nice but not always conducive to adding more photos, so I have decided to look at some companies that host images either for free or pay. The first one, and hopefully only one, that I am trying is Flickr. There is a plugin for iPhoto that will allow you to export from there to your Flickr account, so I want to try that as well. I am hoping to label all of my photos on my Mac, then upload to Flickr and keep all of the labels and meta information. We will see how it works out, but if anyone has any suggestions or comments about Flickr or another company, I am open to suggestions.
