As you can see, I am now in the default look for WordPress 1.5. The upgrade went well, although I had to do a little jimmying with the databases. The main reason I upgraded was the new commenting features which will automatically moderate any brand new commenter, but if you have an approved comment, you will go through. I am hoping this will start to whittle down the comment spam problems I had been running into. I am also excited about the different template options now. I am going to leave this look up for awhile and then design a new one for the site soon, so that is something to look forward to.
