On Wednesday evening, on my third time trying to beat Metroid Prime (the boss), it died at the hands of Samus Aran. After playing through most of the game once and then having to do it again after the theft, Metroid Prime is finally beat. Unfortunately I missed some missile upgrades so I only had a 89% completion rate, however it is nice to have the game beaten finally. Now I have to decide which game to move onto for the Gamecube.
