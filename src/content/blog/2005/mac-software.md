As some of you may know, I am going to be getting a Mac tower in the near future, once Rebekah gets her new iBook. The tower is a Dual 500 Mhz G4 with 1 GB of RAM; I will be putting my DVD burner in it and just got a 17″ LCD for it. This is my first experience with owning a Mac, so while I have used them at work, I am anxious to start doing my own thing. While I have some ideas in mind on how I will have the computer setup, I am looking for suggestions from Mac users for programs they love to use. First, these are the programs I am definately going to have on my machine:

* Mac OS 10.3 (10.4 when it comes out)  
* iLife ‘05 (purchased from Apple.com through the educational discount)  
* Office 2004 (purchased from the IMU Bookstore)  

I am now looking for 3rd party programs that are optimally free, but at least shareware so I can try them out before buying. I am looking for software that will help me manage my media collection. Frank suggested [Delicious Library](http://www.delicious-monster.com), but it doesn’t offer much more than [MediaMan](http://www.imediaman.com) for the PC and MediaMan is free when compared to 40 bucks for DL. I am also looking for a program to catalog my growing comic collection. I am going to try Comics first, but it seems rather limited if the program isn’t good, so if anyone has any suggestions, I am open to them.

I also use Trillian on the PC, so I am assuming that Fire is still the multiservice IM program to use, but if there is a better one, I would be interested in trying it out. I am also open to all sorts of other programs that are recommended to use as I am not open to the entire Mac world, so send your submissions in using the comments below.

If you’re looking for a good media player I’d suggest Video Lan or VLC player. You can get it at download.com. It’s the best free player out there for a mac, in my opinion.

Some programs to mess with:  
IM Program - AdiumX  
Music Library - iTunes (by far the best)  
Weather - Meteorologist  
‘Quick Launcher’ - QuickSilver  

The apps listed above are totally free

Great shareware apps:  
SideTrack - great for trackpad < -> 3button mouse, may not need on a tower I guess.  
Litttle Snitch - application firewall, a great application.  
Synergy - iTunes start/stop/pause/etc program that sits in the menu bar - great app.

I would see if Prell has a prerelease of an unstable build of OS X 10.5. My experience has always been that having a copy of those prereleases comes in awfully handy when hopping around Hotline servers. Plus you can install them on work computers.
