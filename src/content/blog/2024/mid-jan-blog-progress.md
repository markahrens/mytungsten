As mentioned in my previous post, I have been doing some work to get the blog archives restored from the before times on this site. Through various ways of accessing the old site URLs through archive.org, I have had some success. I have everything from 2003-04 and 2013 restored. Some of them even had comments, so I brought those over manually too. Recently I did find an archive that has every single post in it, so I am optimistic that I can get all of the blog posts brought back in time. It is just a time consuming process.

While working on this, I have discovered some interesting things.

* Delicious Library still exists  
* The ESPN Page 2 archives still exist  
* While I have no way of logging into it, [my old Flickr account](https://www.flickr.com/people/mizidymizark/) still exists and all of the links work
* The same goes with [Last.FM](https://www.last.fm/user/mizidymizark)

As part of the update, I have chosen to update some links to be more relevent. For example, when I linked to purchasing a CD on Amazon previously, now it would point to an Apple Music link.

Overall, I am pretty pleased how the whole process is going. I also have enough content brought over that I am noticing things I want to tweak with the design of the site, like adding year headers in the full archive. It is fun though to be working on my personal site all over again.
