I have decided to get the band back together and really give MyTungsten a go again. And by band, I mean getting a WordPress install going, configured with all of the stuff I want to do on this site. What that means is, I am going to be posting links and posts here fairly regularly, links more often than posts. You can count on seeing quite a bit of stuff about web and mobile development, Mac stuff, comic book articles, and just general awesomeness.

If you want to follow what is going on here, I would recommend either the RSS feed or the Twitter account for the site. Both will be updated in real time (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131211165834/http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=ccrhTmWurvQ#t=86s">much like the events of the Highlander</a>), so you should be good to go either way. I am also choosing not to do comments on the site. I could go into a whole thing about it, but my general feeling on it is, I would rather interact with folks on Twitter about my site. I have much better conversations on Twitter than anywhere else on the Internet, so feel free to reply to the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131211165834/http://twitter.com/mytungsten">@MyTungsten</a> account or my personal account <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131211165834/http://twitter.com/themarkahrens">@themarkahrens</a>. I am looking forward to the site, for the first time in a long time, so I hope you enjoy it as well.
