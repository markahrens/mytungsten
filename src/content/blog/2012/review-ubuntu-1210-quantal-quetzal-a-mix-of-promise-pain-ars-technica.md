Ars Technica’s reviews of Ubuntu are my second favorite posts they do, just behind the Siracusa OS X reviews. While I don’t use Linux in the desktop format, I do like to see where Ubuntu is going. It seems to have as much of a market share as a Linux distro is ever going to get on the desktop, so it is nice to that it keeps evolving, even if this release seems to have some issues.
