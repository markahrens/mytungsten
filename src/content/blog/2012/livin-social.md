<p>It seems a little crazy to me that it is quickly approaching a year that I <a title="Gone Google" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131211162727/http://mytungsten.net/2012/02/gone-google/">gave up Google</a>. In that time, there has only been one thing that keeps making me want to start up a new Google account, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131211162727/http://plus.google.com/">Google+</a>. This is probably going to sound really odd because from most accounts, Google+ is really floundering. Over the course of the last year though, it is the only social network that did not have a major negative reaction to some policy change.</p>

<p>With Twitter, there is the huge API kerfuffle that makes me wonder if the app I like to use for Twitter can even function in 6 months. Facebook seemingly has some privacy thing each and every week. I shut down my Instagram account because of their <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131211162727/http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/12/17/what-instagrams-new-terms-of-service-mean-for-you/">Terms of Service change</a> (which they since rolled back, but still…).</p>

<p>I also liked the idea of starting a social network from scratch, with the experience of using things like Twitter and Facebook for years. I can tell you that if I were starting both of those over again, especially Facebook, I would have things setup way differently. Once you are in for so long though, it would take hours to get things setup the way I wanted, and even then, I would have to hope that I got them correct.</p>

<p>With all that, I did a few things today. First, I did actually sign up for Google+. I am not quite done with the profile yet, but you can find me <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131211162727/https://plus.google.com/108045264326844046274/">here</a>.<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131211162727/https://plus.google.com/108045264326844046274/"><br>

</a></p>

<p>Second, I have setup pages on both <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131211162727/https://plus.google.com/114308892085793032057/">Google+</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131211162727/https://www.facebook.com/MyTungsten">Facebook</a> for this site. This is to complement the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131211162727/https://twitter.com/MyTungsten">Twitter account</a> for the site. I will be checking each of those accounts more frequently, so let me know what you think on any of them.</p>
