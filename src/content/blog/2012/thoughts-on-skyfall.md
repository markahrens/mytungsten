<p>First off, this is not a review, just some thoughts about the movie. If you are looking for a review, you should start and end at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131211165834/http://www.zakiscorner.com/2012/11/zakis-review-skyfall.html">Zaki’s fine analysis</a>. Or if that is too long, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131211165834/http://twitter.com/danbenjamin/status/266894477698949120">this</a> covers it too. Second, this contains stuff about the movie which some might consider spoilers. If this is a big deal for you, then feel free to skip this post.</p>

<p>My first thought after the movie ended was that could have been both the last Bond movie ever and also the first. The 50th anniversary of the series was not lost on the writers of this movie. From the island hideout of Raoul Silva paying homage to Dr. No, then showing off he has a fake mouth, making one think of the classic villian Jaws, this movie doesn’t always feel like a Bond movie but never lets you forget that it is.</p>

<p>All of the references to previous movies (including a whole bunch I likely missed) is what makes it feel like the last Bond film. But the reoccurring theme of resurrection also helps it feel like the first one as well. The final scenes of the movie setup the next films but they also make it seem like the first 50 years are now officially done and that the next movies reserve the right to be something totally different. After 23 movies, one would think there is only so much left in the tank with the Bond character and this movie uses up a lot of what was available.&nbsp;I am anxious to see what happens next, whether it is the status quo, or Bond truly is reimagined.</p>
