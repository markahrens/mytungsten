For those of you with Twitter accounts, you very likely have allowed access to some 3rd party applications throughout the years. Well, with the new<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131211162727/https://dev.twitter.com/blog/changes-coming-to-twitter-api"> Twitter API rules</a> that they are instituting, you can help some of those 3rd party developers out by unregistering the app for your account if you are not using it anymore.

To check out what apps have access to your account, log into your account at Twitter.com, then go to&nbsp;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131211162727/https://twitter.com/settings/applications">https://twitter.com/settings/applications</a>. Then just scroll through the list and turn off access to the ones you donâ€™t use anymore. It will help the developer of that app have one more user token freed up, and it also is one fewer application that has access to your account, so it is just good all around.
