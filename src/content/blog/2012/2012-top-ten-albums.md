<p>Without further ado, my top 10 albums of the year, with honorable mentions in no particular order:</p>

<ol>

<li>Twin Shadow – Confess</li>

<li>Recomposed by Max Richter: Vivaldi, The Four Seasons</li>

<li>Lone – Galaxy Garden</li>

<li>Daphni – Jiaolong</li>

<li>John Talabot – Fin</li>

<li>CFCF – Exercises</li>

<li>Dinosaur Jr. – I Bet on Sky</li>

<li>Clark – Iradelphic</li>

<li>Stars – The North</li>

<li>Efterklang – Piramida</li>

</ol>

<p>Honorable Mention</p>

<ul>

<li>Animal Collective – Centipede Hz</li>

<li>Grizzly Bear – Shields</li>

<li>Johann Johannsson – Copenhagen Dreams</li>

<li>The xx – Coexist</li>

</ul>

<p>Overall, it was a pretty strong year for new music. Out of the 64 albums that I listened to, 25 were above average in my opinion.</p>

<p>This list also is albums only. My top EPs for the year were Burial’s Kindred and THGHT’s self titled EP.</p>

<p>**Update**: It was pointed out that Making Mirrors was a 2011 release, which indeed it was, so it has been stricken from the list.</p>
