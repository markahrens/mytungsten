<blockquote>The news that UEFA are considering a dramatic overhaul to&nbsp;their European competitions is fantastic, right up to the moment that you realise UEFA will be handling the changes.</blockquote>

I have to admit that being a fan of Everton, the Europa League is about the best I can hope for. That being said, the recommendation at the end of the article to go back to the way it was does make the most sense. Which means, of course, it has no chance of actually happening.
