So I have decided to pick up the web development stuff again as I have been avoiding the comics database for awhile now.? I do realize that I will get very little done before the wedding, which is in 12 days, however it is worth me thinking about again.? It will also allow me to remove the poll from the sidebar as it appears that Rails has won out.? That means that I have some learning to do, but it should be an interesting ride.

I also might redo the theme for my site for the umpteenth time, but I am kinda bored with this design.? It also doesnâ€™t handle pictures very well, which is something I want to do more of.? So that might be a quick project that I could work on this weekend before tackling the Rails thing after I get back from our trip.
