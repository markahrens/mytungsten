It is 36 degrees with a wind chill of 24 and we are in a severe thunderstorm warning with thunder and lightning all around.  Gotta love November in Iowa.

UPDATE: It did hail here, now it won’t melt because it is too close to freezing.¬? Then there is this awesome picture of severe weather in Iowa.
