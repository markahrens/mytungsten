As you may have heard, there is some sporting event happening here in town tomorrow night.? After some luck, I was able to get tickets for the game and will be viewing it from the 11 row behind the north end zone at Kinnick.? I will also be wearing the shirt below to the game, hopefully in the middle of a bunch of OSU fans.

With the Game of the Week, Iowa City also plays host to College Gameday.? I have posted some <a target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131211070641/http://www.flickr.com/photos/mizidymizark/tags/gameday/">setup pictures of Gameday</a> on <a target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131211070641/http://www.flickr.com/photos/mizidymizark/">my Flickr account</a>, but for those of you too lazy to go there, you can see that the setup is taking up most of Hubbard Park.

<div style="text-align: left">I am predicting a close game with both Tate and Smith making some big plays.? I don’t want to pick a winner in fear of offending the football gods, I just want a good game.? That being said, I am leaving everyone with this <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131211070641/http://www.iowasexoffender.com/sho.php?id=60952481&amp;L_isonums=&amp;sub=&amp;lastone=">Moment of Zen</a>.</div>
