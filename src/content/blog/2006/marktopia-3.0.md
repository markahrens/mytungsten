As you may have noticed, Marktopia has a new look once again.  The colors stayed similiar, some stuff shifted around and I can now take advantage of the [Wordpress Widgets engine](https://automattic.com/code/widgets/) to add things to the site.  This is pretty exciting as it will not take much work at all to change things on the sidebar.  The one thing missing on the sidebar right now is the Now Reading stuff.  This is because I found out there is a new version that does lots of cool new stuff, including making a dynamic page displaying lots more information, including reviews.  I am going to need to take a look at this in more detail before putting it up on the site to make sure it works with the overall theme of the site.  That will be coming soon, as will a new comics section that I have been wanting to work on for awhile now.
