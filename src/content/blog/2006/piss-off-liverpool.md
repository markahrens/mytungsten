<p>Taking <a target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131211130938/http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/page2/story?page=simmons/060719">Sports Guy’s lead</a>, I have decided to find myself an EPL team to dedicate my time to.  As if I didn’t have enough sports going on with Iowa, the Bucs, Cubs, occasional Formula 1, I decided that I also need to start watching English Premier League Soccer.  So after reading through his reviews of each team and doing minor investigative work myself, I have chosen to support <a target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131211130938/http://www.evertonfc.com/home/">Everton</a> for this season.  Any team that can be described as being similar to the Oakland A’s, I am OK with.  Making it easy to follow the team, I have the main Everton RSS feed and the BBC Everton news loaded up in Shrook and have the Everton schedule saved on my del.icio.us account.  Combine that with the Fox Soccer Channel and I should have some fun following my new favorite team.</p>
