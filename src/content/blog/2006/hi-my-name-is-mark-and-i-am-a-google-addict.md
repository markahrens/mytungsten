I am openly admitting it, I am a Google addict.? I came to that realization tonight while looking at <a target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131211165826/http://reader.google.com/">Google Reader</a>.? It isn’t perfect, but I kept thinking of reasons I should use that instead of the wonderful Shrook.? I don’t think I am dropping Shrook anytime soon, but I might export the OMPL file to give Google Reader a test.? And that is where Google keeps winning me over, they make it easy enough for me to try something. They got me in the door with Gmail, now I just keep adding different services to my Google account.? There are some on there, such as <a target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131211165826/http://base.google.com/">Google Base</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131211165826/http://pages.google.com/">Google Page Creator</a>, that I used once and never tried again.? But then there are things like <a target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131211165826/http://www.writely.com/">Writely</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131211165826/http://spreadsheet.google.com/">Spreadsheets</a> that I have come back to recently to see what improvements have been made.? They have figured out how to keep a web junkie like me interested in one company for a long time.? Oh yeah, there was that YouTube thing today also. Now if only Picasa Web Albums supported geotagging with Google Maps, I would consider switching from <a target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131211165826/http://www.flickr.com/photos/mizidymizark/">Flickr</a>.
