My <a href="/web/20131211070641/http://mytungsten.net/music">music database</a> has been finished off, filling it up with all sorts of good data.? I should say that the albums are all in there, I have not filled in all of the artist info at this time, and it may be awhile before doing that.? However, I am pleased to be done with the data entry part of the project and can now start thinking about other stuff I want to do with the <a href="/web/20131211070641/http://mytungsten.net/mizcd">MizCD project</a> and start working on the comics database.? Unfortunately that is another monster on itâ€™s own that I will have to tackle, but at least the data entry involves going through all my comics, so that is kinda cool.

One other comment I will make, you may have noticed the Now Reading thing on the sidebar.? In addition to keeping track of what I am reading, the Now Reading also supports reviewing each book, so if you want my opinions on the books that show up in the sidebar, check out the <a href="/web/20131211070641/http://mytungsten.net/library">library area</a> of the site.
