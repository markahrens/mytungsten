<p>If you have seen <a target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131211165826/http://www.flickr.com/photos/mizidymizark/">my Flickr account</a> in the last day, you have likely seen pictures of our newest addition.  A cute little black female kitten named Monstar has been purring and wrestling her way around the apartment for just over 24 hours now.  She does get along with Purrball fairly well, although there was a bit of a rumble after dinner tonight.  A picture of the two can be seen below.  This does conclude new additions for awhile so you will have to deal with pictures of Purrball and Monstar in the meantime.</p>
