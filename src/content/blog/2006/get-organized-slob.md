<p>So when my Macbook went down for a couple of days, I found myself at a bit of a loss because I had to backup my data and just tonight restoring it back to the Macbook.? It did get me thinking of what I need on my laptop vs. what can sit in storage here on the Mac at home.? It then got me thinking more of what is the best way to collect important things about my life in the most efficient way.? I have e-mails, comics, music, documents, calendar stuff, contacts, etc, yet none of the most important stuff is collected in one place.? Worse off, even if I did have that, I don’t have a great place to store stuff I just want to keep and don’t need on a day to day basis.? The perfect solution would be keeping the most important stuff on the Macbook with an easy way to transfer files from the Mac at home, even when I am at work.? I am open to thoughts and suggestions, so have at it.</p>
