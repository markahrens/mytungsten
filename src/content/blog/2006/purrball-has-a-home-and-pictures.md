<p>Today we brought home a new addition to our family.? Purrball was picked up at the <a target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131211095301/http://www.icanimalcenter.org/">Iowa City Animal Shelter</a> at 4:30 and promptly brought home to start exploring his new home.? He was cautious at first, but is slowly getting used to his new surroundings.? He likes the chair in the second bedroom and we have had success with both him eating and using the litter box, so we are looking good so far.? Pictures have been posted on Flickr and will be added under the <a target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131211095301/http://www.flickr.com/photos/mizidymizark/tags/purrball/">purrball tag</a>.</p>
