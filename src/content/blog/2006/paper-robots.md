After seeing <a target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131211130938/http://blog.urbanfarmgirl.net/?p=242">Rebekah’s post</a> about the paper Mac and then seeing Scott’s rather sad looking paper Macs, I decided to post my old photos of the paper robot collection I made back in the summer of 03.? The ones I made were a collection of robots, one for each letter of the alphabet, however not really associated with the specific letter.? In any case, my Flickr account now has a <a target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131211130938/http://www.flickr.com/photos/mizidymizark/sets/72157594206265402/">set dedicated to the paper robots</a>, so enjoy.
