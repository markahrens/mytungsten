<p>Last night I knew that Everton was going to be playing Columbus of the MLS, but I did not think it was televised anywhere I could see, so I had reserved myself to that fact.? After dinner last night, I did some flipping of the channels and to my delight the match was being shown on ESPN2, so I got to watch the entire thing.? I was pleased with some of the play of Everton, however there was a lot of the match where they looked like a team that was getting back into sync.? I cannot say I am pleased about the result with a 1-1 tie, however since Columbus has been playing for half of a season and it is still preseason for the EPL, I can accept the result.? Needless to say, this did get me just a little more excited for the beginning of the league.</p>
