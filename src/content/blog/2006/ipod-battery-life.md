<p>One of the agreements Rebekah and I made about some of the wedding gifts was to each get a better present for ourselves.&nbsp; Rebekah chose a Kitchenaid mixer and I chose a new 80 GB iPod.&nbsp; It has been about 4 years since I got my first iPod, so I have had a lot of fun tinkering with the new features, such as the photos and videos.&nbsp; I also started messing with having my calendar on the iPod so I can have that with me as well with my only qualm being that the iPod does not show the location field when viewing an entry.&nbsp; Last night I was checking on availability for an appointment, I must have accidentally hit play for music as I put the iPod away because when I checked the iPod this morning, it was playing still with the battery almost dead.&nbsp; I was quite impressed that it had gotten 15 hours of constant music playback, so I decided to drain the battery and have kept listening all morning.&nbsp; I am now at 17 hours straight and the iPod keeps trucking.&nbsp; Color me impressed when compared to the old 8 hrs I got on my original iPod.</p>
