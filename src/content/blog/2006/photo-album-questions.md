With <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131211165826/http://www.markandrebekah.net/">MarkandRebekah.net</a> setup, we are deciding on the best way to manage our photos.  We are looking at a locally hosted solution vs. Flickr because we have a ton of space now and we can manage the look and feel of the pages.  I do like Flickr and we will keep using for now even though my Pro account expires tomorrow, but something local will give us more flexibility.  I have started looking at programs such as <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131211165826/http://gallery.menalto.com/">Gallery</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131211165826/http://coppermine-gallery.net/index.php">Coppermine</a>, but I am open to other suggestions.  The big feature I am looking for is tagging or keywords to organize based on that as well as albums in addition to being easy to edit the CSS for the program.  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131211165826/http://gallery.menalto.com/">Gallery2</a> has the tagging as part of that in their nightly builds right now, but if anyone has other suggestions or pleas to keep using Flickr, feel free to comment.
