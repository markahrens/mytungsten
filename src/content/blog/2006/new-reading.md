As you may have noticed, the Now Reading widget was added this evening. I got it customized a lot faster than I expected and the full library view also works just fine. I need to add books that I am planning to read again, but it has a decent history of stuff in there now. If you read a lot and have a Wordpress blog, I would recommend checking this plugin out.
