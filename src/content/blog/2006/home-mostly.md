Rebekah and I got back from our honeymoon yesterday with almost everything.¬? Our luggage is still somewhere between Disney World’s Caribbean Beach Resort and the Eastern Iowa Airport.¬? This would normally not be a big deal, some clothes and toiletries missing, however we did a fair amount of shopping for ourselves and Christmas.¬? While we are holding out hope for our luggage, it is depressing thinking that souvenirs of our first vacation together might be sitting in some warehouse never to be seen by us again.¬? It may not seem like much to everyone else, but it has gotten us both down today and we both are anxious to hear something.¬? Gifts and trinkets are still part of our memories and to have that taken away from us is tough for us to swallow.
