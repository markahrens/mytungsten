<p>First off, I have given <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131211130938/http://www.flock.com/" target="_blank">Flock</a> another fair shake and I just cannot stick with it.  It has nice stuff, but it just isn’t clicking with me.  The biggest problem is the inconsistency with bookmarking a page with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131211130938/http://del.icio.us/mizidymizark/" target="_blank">del.icio.us</a> and the news section not updating as well as I would like.  I might give it another look when it hits the 1.0, but for now I am back to Safari and a news reader.  At this time, I am using <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131211130938/http://www.utsire.com/shrook/" target="_blank">Shrook</a>, recommended by <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131211130938/http://www.thewilysnicker.com/" target="_blank">Kevlar</a>.  It seems to be pretty nice and has a number of features I don’t know what they do yet, so it might be cool to mess around with.</p>

<p>In addition to browser stuff, I have (once again) decided to experiment with Rails.  This time I am using <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131211130938/http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/097669400X/sr=8-1/qid=1152113341/ref=pd_bbs_1/104-8741431-2292756?ie=UTF8" target="_blank">Agile Web Development with Rails</a> instead of some web guide.  This ended up being a great idea because this is the book I have needed for Rails from the beginning.  This explains why anyone would use MVC or Rails in general and gives a good tutorial.  I am less than 100 pages into the book and I already am excited to build my own Rails app.</p>
