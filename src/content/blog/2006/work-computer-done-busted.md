<p>So my Macbook has been having problems the last 3 days.? Randomly the machine will shut down, that is about it.? Unfortunately none of the recommendations from the AppleCare techs could help so it is being sent back for Apple to take a look at.? This means that I will be sans computer at home for the next week or so.? I guess that means I donâ€™t have an excuse not to work on the comic database db design.</p>
