In a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131211115308/http://www.marktopia.net/2006/11/29/turkey-and-web-developing/" target="">recent post</a>, I asked for opinions about a blog editor program.  After a little research and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131211115308/http://www.lifehacker.com/software/personal-organizers/download-of-the-day-journler-mac-219445.php" target="_blank">a post on Lifehacker</a>, I have decided to go with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131211115308/http://www.journler.com/" target="_blank">Journler</a>.  In addition to being a good blog editor, I am also going to try and use it as a general note taking program.  I have been carrying around my portfolio to meetings lately instead of my laptop since I havnâ€™t found a great note taking program, so hopefully this will meet my needs.
