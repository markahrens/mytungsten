<p>Since Rails is what the people asked for, Rails is what the people are gonna get.&nbsp; I am starting work on the comic database and so the first step is to get Rails up and going on my local machine so I can do development easily.&nbsp; I have started by using <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131211172932/http://locomotive.raaum.org/">Locomotive</a>, a very nice program that allows you to run a Rails server without configuring the system.&nbsp; As I get further into the program, I think having the system actually configured to do Rails automatically is going to work better, so that is the big step for tonight.&nbsp; After that, development and learning will commence.</p>
