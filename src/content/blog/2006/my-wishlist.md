After experimenting with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131211085122/http://www.gifttagging.com/">Gifttagging.com</a> and a number of other sites, I have decided to use the built-in Amazon wishlist for now.  Nothing else seems to work as easily as it and now I have a nicely organized wishlist for myself, either when I have some extra money or if someone wants to buy me something.  I am going to add a link on the main page but if you donâ€™t want to wait, here is my <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131211085122/http://www.amazon.com/gp/registry/wishlist/1PKRV3MXPXOC3/102-2822245-3374526?reveal=unpurchased&amp;filter=all&amp;sort=priority&amp;layout=standard&amp;x=5&amp;y=6">Amazon wishlist</a>.
