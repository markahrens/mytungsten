As you may have noticed, the Now Reading widget was added this evening.  I got it customized a lot faster than I expected and the <a href="/web/20131211085122/http://mytungsten.net/library/">full library view</a> also works just fine.  I need to add books that I am planning to read again, but it has a decent history of stuff in there now.  If you read a lot and have a WordPress blog, I would recommend <a target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131211085122/http://robm.me.uk/projects/plugins/wordpress/now-reading/">checking this plugin</a> out.
