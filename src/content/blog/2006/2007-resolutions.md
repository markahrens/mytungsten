<p>I never got into the whole yearly resolutions thing, mainly because I always got frustrated looking back at resolutions I forgot about or didn’t accomplish.  As I get older, I am beginning to realize that setting these resolutions is more for peace of mind rather than a bunch of stuff that has to get done for the year.  Yes, some of the things I really do want to do this year, but some would just be nice to get checked off the list.  I am also breaking them down by different categories since categories are so much fun to do.</p>

<p>Tech (Work or Home)</p>

<ul>

<li>Learn ASP.NET – This will be useful at work and in the long term.</li>

<li>Continue tweaking the Comics Database – To keep up with my main Rails experience, I figure I should keep tweaking the program if there are places that could use improvement.</li>

<li>Develop Coffee Database – As some of you may remember, I once had a listing of all the beers I tried.  It was all done with static pages and since I quit drinking before I started messing with databases, it didn’t make much sense to migrate it to one.  Now I drink coffee, and my sense of curiosity for trying new coffees is similiar to my beer drinking, this seems like a basic/fun application</li>

<li>Install Leopard and make my own widget – This one is more for fun, however finishing the goal of a Help Desk Outages widget would be cool</li>

<li>Finish new Help Desk Outages stuff – This project has been started already, but knowing how priorities change at work, I want to make sure this gets done</li>

</ul>

<p>Personal Life (Not that kinda personal)</p>

<ul>

<li>Pay off some loans – Being in debt isn’t that much fun, so paying off a couple of loans this year would be good.  Rebekah and I are on track to do this, so baring some major change, it shouldn’t be a problem.</li>

<li>Start saving for a house – This starts happening after the above resolution.</li>

<li>Take a trip to San Francisco – This one falls under the maybe category, but I love San Fran and Rebekah has never been there.</li>

<li>Drink 64 oz of water every day – I need to get healthier and water will help.  Nuff details about that for now.</li>

</ul>

<p>Social Stuff</p>

<ul>

<li>Take a class – This is wide open.  Rebekah and I started taking a ballroom class right before the wedding.  It was a bit intense and a lot too close to the wedding, but it did get me interested in taking some sort of class, maybe photography.</li>

</ul>

<p>Stuff Stuff (List of expensive things that I want)</p>

<ul>

<li>Nintendo Wii</li>

<li>Second car</li>

<li>Digital SLR</li>

<li>High Def TV</li>

</ul>

<p>I will be adding to this list throughout the week with the plan to have this finalized by Jan 1, so check back after the 1st to see the final list.</p>
