Last weekend Rebekah and I traveled to Kentucky for a family reunion on her side of the family.? Fun was had by all and pictures are <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131211085122/http://www.flickr.com/photos/mizidymizark/sets/72157594171476152/">now posted on my Flickr account</a>.? I have not edited all the names of the pictures or tagged them yet, but you can get the jist of the trip.? Some things to note, all barns in Kentucky are black which weirded out everyone, especially Rebekahâ€™s brother, everything in Kentucky is historic and Shaker Villages can have running water and electricity.
