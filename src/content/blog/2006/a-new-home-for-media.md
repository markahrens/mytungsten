<p>Rebekah and I have got a solution to our music/pictures combination problem.  It is called an iMac!  Long story short, instead of a Wii, we have decided to get a new computer for the office where we can share the machine and have a home for all of our music and pictures.  It will be considerably faster than the current tower and has plenty of hard drive space for whatever needs to live on the machine.  We are quite excited as it will solve a number of issues we have been having on where to store our data.</p>
