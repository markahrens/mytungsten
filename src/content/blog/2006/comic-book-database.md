Well, after long last, I am ready to show off my first Rails application.  Designed to organize my comics, I have a number of database relationships that I had to learn how to handle with the models and whatnot.  The end result is a pretty neat site.  I have to add more content and will be working on the styles, but feel free to go to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131211115308/http://comic.marktopia.net/" target="">comic.marktopia.net</a> to check it out and leave comments here on what you think.
