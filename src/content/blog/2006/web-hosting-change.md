<p>Just a quick note, to save money overall Rebekah and I are consolidating our web hosting to a single account.¬? Because of the rave reviews, I gave <a target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131211165826/http://www.dreamhost.com/">Dreamhost</a> a look and I was sucked in by the 200 GB of space and 2 TB (yes TB) of bandwidth per month.¬? My site is all moved over so the next step is to get <a target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131211165826/http://www.urbanfarmgirl.net/">Urbanfarmgirl</a> moved over and then deciding on what we want our combined domain name will be.¬? We are open to comments, although all will be taken with a grain of salt.</p>
