Yesterday Rebekah and I purchased a new digital camera, a Canon PowerShot SD450. A bit of an improvement over my old camera, the new one has 5 MP compared to the 2.1 on my old one. We havnâ€™t had much of an opportunity to use it yet, but we did take a few pics of the tornado damage in Iowa City on the drive home from church today. If you are interested in checking out some of the pics from the new camera, they are in the first 5 pictures in the [Tornado Damage in Iowa City](http://www.flickr.com/photos/mizidymizark/sets/72057594106916152/) set. With the new camera, we will likely be taking more pics in the near future, so stay tuned.
