<p>For those of you unaware, I had to send my Macbook back to Apple again for the same shutting down problem I had before.  This time it took nearly 2 weeks for me to get it back instead of the 3 days, but hopefully it means it is fixed now.  One of the things they had to replace was the hard drive, so I have a pristine system with all my data missing. Luckily I backed up the good stuff before hand so it is no big deal, but it did give me an opportunity to see what applications are most important to me based on the order of installation on a new machine.  Without further ado:</p>

<p>1. <a target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131211070641/http://www.getfirefox.com/">Firefox</a><br>

2. OS Software Updates<br>

<p>I also removed Garageband and it’s music files to clear up about 5 GB of space.  I also had to configure Mail and the Address Book for the University stuff, messed with the Finder windows so they open in the column view and shrunk the desktop icons to 32×32 instead of 48×48.  It is nice to be back at home on the Mac.</p>
