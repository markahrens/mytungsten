<p>Today I got the trade for the classic Marvel event, Secret Wars, which got me thinking about other major events that I have not had a chance to read yet. I have read the following:</p>

<ul>

<li>Civil War (In Progress)</li>

<li>Annihilation (In Progress)</li>

<li>House of M</li>

<li>Avengers Disassembled</li>

<li>Onslaught</li>

<li>Infinity Gauntlet</li>

<li>Infinity War</li>

</ul>

<p>I have also read about half of the Age of Apocalypse so far, but that is a lot to go through. So basically I am now checking with other Marvel people to find out what other events I should be looking up and checking out.</p>
