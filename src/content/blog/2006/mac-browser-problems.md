Since getting my new computer, I have been using Safari as my web browser. It isn’t really bloated and some of the bookmark stuff is nice with it, so I decided to stick with it. I remember reading that many newer sites have issues in Safari, but kinda ignored that at first. Now I have run into about 3 or 4 sites that just don’t work in Safari, including the rich text editor for Wordpress.

The question is, do I keep with Safari and be one of those people that rants and raves about how all these sites are ignoring the Mac user, or do I try out Camino or Firefox and know that things will work then? Right now I am leaning towards Camino since it is a Universal binary and will likely run better than Firefox on my laptop, but I am open to other thoughts.

Camino’s the fastest browser for me, but the RSS bookmarking in Safari keeps me using it (despite the occasional crash).

http://pimpmysafari.com/ has some good plug-ins. My absolute favorite of all time is taboo… it gives you a warning if you accidentally close the window instead of just a tab. I hate accidentally closing a window full of tabs. It doesn’t look like there is a universal binary yet, but keep your eyes out.
