Once again I have been enticed by the fad that is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131211085122/http://www.flock.com/">Flock</a>.? Now in an official beta, I figured that it would be worth looking at again.? I must say that many of the little things that had bugged me in the past are gone and I am actually liking using it.? It is not the perfect tool some might think it is, but it does a lot of the stuff pretty good.? For example, I am actually using it to write this post in the built-in blog editor and the search bar is quite useful doing an automatic search of your history, del.icio.us bookmarks and the web.? It also loads faster than Firefox on the Mac and has an adequate RSS reader built-in so while it isn’t perfect, it does things well enough that I don’t feel the need to use other programs.
