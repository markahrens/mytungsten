I havn’t written in awhile, so I thought I would post that I am alive and that I enjoyed Thanksgiving.¬? I am also working on the comics database.¬? Basically the more I mess with Rails, the more I like it, so it is taking my time right now.¬? I also am becoming less thrilled with the WordPress web page editor, so I am looking for suggestions on good desktop applications that handle blogging on a Mac.¬? Feel free to comment those suggestions, or don’t.
