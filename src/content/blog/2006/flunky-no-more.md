<p>I am pleased to announce that I have accepted a position with Web Technology Services at ITS here at the University.  There will be some transition time when I am working in both worlds, but I am looking forward to the change as it will allow me to continue developing my skills with the web.  I will also get to work with students still, mentoring them on how to make compliant, good looking sites.</p>
