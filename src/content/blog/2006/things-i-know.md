So I keep reading about writing blogs that you should write about things you know and/or like. I am going to try to start following that mantra by keeping to a few topics on the blog and trying to update more frequently. Here will be the key topics:

* Web Development - I am not a pro at this, but it is something I enjoy and feel I can write about  
* Comics - I have been collecting for almost a year now and know my stuff about the Marvel Universe, so I feel it is time to start writing about it
* Music and Movies - These will be less frequent, but I occasonally feel like ranting about a new movie or something
* Life Events - Things like tornados and weddings fall under this category

I am also getting closer to the new Marktopia theme, it is coming along nicely so I am hoping sometime soon for a unveiling.
