The Cubs better win the World Series this year, because if not, I don’t know that I can watch sports ever again. First, I have to see Darek Lowe get two called strikes which were BS, then I have to see a “leaping” call, ruin the Bucs game. I know that both Oakland and the Bucs shouldn’t have let it get anywhere near that close, but the refs did decide each game, and all I can think of is Scottie Pippen getting called for a foul against the Knicks in the 95 playoffs. I am disgusted.

PS: After Manny hit his home run, I wish that the Oakland fan that got choked out by the police would have ran onto the field and beat his ass silly.
