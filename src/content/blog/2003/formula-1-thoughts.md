Sundayâ€™s Selected Quotes - French GP

So, the French Grand Prix is in the books, and a rather uneventful race goes by the books. It is nice to see that Williams.BMW is rolling again with their second 1-2 finish in a row. They are now only 3 points behind Ferrari in the constructors race, so the next few races will be interesting to watch. It will also be interesting to see how JPM handles the success of Ralf and JPM is technically the #1 racer for BMW.

I was kinda bummed to see that Jacques just finished out of the points again. I really hope that he either gets a good ride next year or just leaves Formula 1. He took the risk in helping found a new team in BAR, but the success just isnt there. I think that he would be a great fit with the Renault Team, being that he is French-Canadian, their car is showing more and more improvment and he can show if he does still have it.

I also watched some of the F3000 race and watching those races makes me hope more and more that Townsend Bell gets a chance to go to F1. F1 really needs to have an American driver to help bolster support here in the states. I really think that he could go to the Minardi team; they need as much help as possible, and an American driver might help out.
