I finally decided to switch off of the crutch that was Blogger and get a nice blogging program. Upon TCW recommendations and reviews I read online, I decided to go with MovableType. Thanks to Mattbot for helping me with the setup of the program, as you can see, the entries from Blogger were able to be imported as well.
