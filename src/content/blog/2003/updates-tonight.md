Tonight I am planning on cleaning up MyTungsten a little, archiving some old content, updating the CSS, etc. I am hoping to start using a feature of CSS where you can have multiple style sheets for the same page, that way I can allow a user to go back to an old look of MyTungsten while adding new looks as well. This can be done by using the StyleSwitcher extension for Firebird.
