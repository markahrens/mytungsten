So, because of the awesome line up, including Ojeda, Miller, Karros and Glanville last night, the Cubs lost to the Astros. Because of my disgust, Cubs Boycott 2.0 will begin if the Cubs do not take the next 3 games from the ASS-tros. The length of this boycott will run until September 15 if it does begin.
