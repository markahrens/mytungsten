Well, after the [blockbuster trade](https://www.espn.com/mlb/news/2003/0722/1584326.html) earlier this week, the Cubs Boycott (Originally scheduled to end Aug. 1), has been postponed indefinately. Although the trade has not shown any help yet (Cubs are 0-2 since the trade), I have a good feeling about the year. This series with the ASS-tros this weekend is huge, but not make-or-break yet. So we hold out hope, at least until the middle of August, when if the Cubs are in trouble, the boycott might come back.
