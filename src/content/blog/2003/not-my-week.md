I am pretty sure that the world is against me this week. First I have to deal with the Bucs loss, then the Cubs loss last night. I have wicked chapped lips, my throat still isnt perfect, and when looking for a job through Monster.com, every time I submitted an application, I would have to go through and choose my options to search all over again. I donâ€™t know if I can make another winter here in the Midwest.
