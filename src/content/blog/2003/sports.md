Well, I am hoping all of the bad umping and karma is out of our systems after last night and we are ready for a huge series from the Cubs. I am beginning to realize that it doesnâ€™t really matter what the Cubs rotation is, as long as Prior and Woody are pitching twice in a series, it is gonna look good on paper. I also think the Marlins lineup is good for the Cubs with so many right handers in it. So, I think the Cubs are going to win it in 5, although winning in 6 would work better since it would be at Wrigley with Prior pitching. I think Game 1 is going to be huge for the Cubs to win. If they can get the upper hand and then have Prior and Wood pitch the next two games, it may not be pretty.
