From the makers of Best in Show, we have A Mighty Wind. A Mighty Wind is another “mock-umentary” about the world of folk music, 35 years after it’s prime. While the movie has some hilarious moments, it also surprises with some emotional moments. While this leads to a less amusing movie overall, I think it leaves a better taste in your mouth afterwards. Not quite what I expected, but a good movie none the less.
