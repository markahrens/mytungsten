All of your doubters in the past have finally been proven wrong as the [Climate Prediction distributed project](https://www.climateprediction.net) has finally been released to the public. Although it is only for PCs, there is an offical release, so anyone who isnâ€™t running a distrib project and is looking for one, I would highly recommend this.
