Having purchased a number of television DVDs recently, I have run across a few episodes of Family Guy and the Simpsons which I saw on TV recently, so I don’t need to see them on DVD. However, I have watched the episodes that have commentary with them, since they are fresh in my mind, just to find out what the creators thought. 9 times out of 10, I have been bored by them and slept walk through them, but tonight I watched Saturdays of Thunder off of the Simpsons Season 3 DVD. This is the best commentary I have had on DVD ever, the writers came on and are as witty as they were when they were writing for the Simpsons. I won’t say more, you should just watch, it is that good.
