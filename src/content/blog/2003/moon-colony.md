[BBC NEWS | Science/Nature | Moon colony ‘within 20 years’](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/3161695.stm)

As some of you may know, I am a huge proponent of space travel. Although I think Mars is a much better goal, establishing a Moon colony is a good step. While I would prefer to see NASA setting up these plans, it is nice to see other space organizations setting up programs with lofty goals as opposed to another Mars satellite which will detect whether ants can sort tiny screws in space. NASA hasn’t done much besides blow up a couple of space shuttles and launch some military satellites since 1980. This is all fine and dandy, but resting on the laurals of the Hubble won’t last much longer. NASA needs to put someone on the Moon or Mars or risk falling behind the EU, India and China in space programs.
