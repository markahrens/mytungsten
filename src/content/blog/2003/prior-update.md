“Prior (13-5) has dominated in five starts since coming off the 15-day disabled list from a bruised shoulder on Aug. 4. During that time he’s 5-0 with two complete games and an 0.69 ERA (three earned runs in 39 innings), lowering his overall ERA to 2.47.”

If Prior could keep similar stats up through the end of September, then the all star reliever who gave up the win for Kerry Wood in the All Star game won’t win the Cy Young.
