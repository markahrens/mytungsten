So, Jake asked if I could give him a ride home after work today, so being the nice guy I am, I said I would. As I am driving waiting to turn left onto Riverside Drive off the Burlington Street bridge, Jake and I watched a truck carrying hay barrels turning right onto the bridge. We watched as the last giant hay barrel started to tip over, off the truck and into the middle of traffic. The truck simply drive away as this hay barrel sat blocking all lanes of east bound traffic at 5 PM. Needless to say, I felt redeemed in my good deed, as that hay barrel gave both Jake and I a hardy chuckle. I think Jakeâ€™s good deed for the day was working with Brian, in case you were wondering.
