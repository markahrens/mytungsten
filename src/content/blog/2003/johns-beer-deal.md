So I went to [John’s](http://www.johnsgrocery.com/) today to grab their variety pack. Apparantly a water pipe broke, so they made a bunch of assortment packs and selling them for $12.99. Here is what I got:

Coor’s Light (1)
MGD (2)
Leinie’s Creamy Dark (1)
Leinie’s Amber Light (1)
Sauza Diablo (3)
Rolling Rock (1)
Jack’s Hard Cola (3)
Foster’s (4)
Capitol Maibock (4)
Heineken (1)
Schell Octoberfest (3)

Not too bad of a deal, 1/4 is malternatives, but overall, not a bad deal.
