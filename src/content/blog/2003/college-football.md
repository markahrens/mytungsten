So, I have watched two specials on college football tonight and not once was Iowa mentioned. While this happened last year as well, it is a bit frustrating to hear Jeff Smoker named in a possible Heisman race and Fred Russell ignored. Iowa won’t go 8-0 in the Big Ten again, but they will be good enough to make a bowl. Jeff Smoker hasn’t shown that he can stop drinking booze and has lost Charles Rogers. Honestly, the media ignores Iowa, and I think that Iowa will surprise everyone again and have a 10-2 season, with Fred Russell not being injured and go to New York being in the top 5 in the Heisman race, very similar to Larry Johnson last year.
