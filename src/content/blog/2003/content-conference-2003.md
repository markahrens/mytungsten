This yearâ€™s version of the Content Conference was held on Monday, November 3. The major topic of discussion was the arrangement of the RSS feeds on thecontentwebring.com. Due to the recent addition of the .Frank to the blogging and RSS world, there was much commotion about how much space Asstastic was using and the location of the Oculon feed. So the impromptu conference was opened. Minutes of the conference can be found here.

All in all, a peaceful resolution to the matter was found and the updated thecontentwebring.com is up and running. The Content Webring would like to thank fbroz for keeping the minutes of the conference.
