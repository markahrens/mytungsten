When I was scanning a [friendâ€™s blog](http://290revisited.blogspot.com/2003/11/finally.html), I noticed that he had posted some news about Stephen King finishing the Dark Tower series. Having anticipated this as much as most people who have read the first 4, I did not believe it at first. After hitting up news.google, I found that the 5th book has been released, and the final two are expected next year. Brew-ya indeed.
