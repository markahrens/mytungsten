For those of you looking for a good X-mas cartoon before the holidays, I would recommend both *A Very Special Family Guy Freakin’ Christmas* off of the second volume of the Family Guy DVD and XMas Story off of the second season of Futurama.

The Family Guy episode was written during the second season and was deemed too inappropriate to view in the normal time slot, so when it was finally shown, many people missed it. However, the few of us who were at Joe’s Place that evening will remember reading the subtitles and laughing our asses off at it.

As for the Futurama episode, you have an evil Santa, Bender dancing and a special appearance by Conan O’Brien, so it can’t be all bad. And if you have the DVD, like you should, the commentary is some of the funniest I have ever heard.
