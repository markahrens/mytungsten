In an effort to make an ordinary Friday afternoon annoying, a number of Content Webring members attempted to hijack the 3 people who check out www.thecontentwebring.com by creating www.tehcontentwebring.com and using the original site and putting some frames around it. After consulting some law sites, I found that framing another site is copyright infringement, and to protect my interests, I have prevented my site from being framed.

Also, in an effort to keep www.thecontentwebring.com safe for users 3-80, I have chosen to remove the description field from the RSS feeds. Much like the guy who pissed all over the gas station restroom so now you have to buy something to use it, a member of the ring had to ruin it for everyone.
