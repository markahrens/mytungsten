Well, for the first time I have used it, the Wayback Machine actually worked for me. I was able to find the old Glenbard North Current web site back from 97 when I helped contribute the occasional music review. Click here to get to the main site and take a look at the entertainment sections to find out why I didnâ€™t take the AP English exam.
