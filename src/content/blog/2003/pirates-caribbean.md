I had wanted to see Pirates in the theater, but I never got around to it. I decided to get it through Netflix, but was hesitant to see it because it is almost 2 1/2 hours long Lluckily my dad had a copy and since I had some free time at home, so I watched it then. Needless to say, I was pretty surprised at how good this movie was. Everyone had told me how great it was, but I was still a little skeptical.

For being a fairly action filled movie, it had a good plot and enough twists to keep you interested. Loosely based on the ride at Disneyland, we have undead pirates trying to find peace, we have a nice love story and lots of pirate fighting. Although I have no idea what they are gonna do for a sequel, it should be good because Johnny Depp has signed on, and he was simply amazing in his role. In any case, I would go on about this film, but you should just see it for yourself because it is that good.
