So I updated the Beer Resource Center and got up the last of the Paper Robots, so have a gander. On a different note, the Hawk win again and looked good beating up on Buffalo. Hopefully it leads to a good week of practice and going into Ames to pick up a win. Another good sign, the Cubs are playing well, now we just need the ASS-tros to lose a game or two. Hopefully the Cubs will take advantage of the easier schedule in September to get into the playoffs. Now if only work would slow down some, things would really start looking up.
