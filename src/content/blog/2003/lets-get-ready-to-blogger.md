So the blog trend continues on TCW, some harassment from other TCW members have led me to take this drastic step. And this is useful as I can update my site from anywhere with an Internet connection and call it “content.” I do know this isn’t real content, but it still will get by the manditory update requirements for TCW. So, when I am not doing consult here at the ITS No Help Desk, I may have a chance to give you my opinions on things and stuff. Cause that is what really matters, things and stuff.
