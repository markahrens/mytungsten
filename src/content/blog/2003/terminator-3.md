The first movie I rented from Netflix was pretty good. I was a bit sceptical going into it as I enjoyed Terminator 2 and it had been 10 years for the next one to come out. While it wasnâ€™t as dark and intense as the second one, I still thought it was entertaining. The new villian, the T-X was interesting and rather easy on the eyes. The special effects were well done, although there were times when I could see the CG parts. The plot was good and did well to explain how it fit in with the first two movies, something I was worried about. Overall, I was impressed and am looking forward to the sequel which might be the movie many have been wanting to see, the War against the Machines.
