This evening was spent decoding and encoding video files to figure out how to make DVDs. I did get a test DVD made with one episode of Aqua Teen Hunger Force. I must now spend all of tomorrow encoding mp4 files into mpeg-2 format. As a backup, I am gonna try to download as many episodes online tonight, we will see how that works out.

Since I had plenty of time to wait, I have been working on the paper robots, and I must say they are coming along nicely. You can see two of the finished products here and here. Finally this evening, I leave you with a picture of my ”ultimate computer setup.” It is quite nerdy, but has been fun to play with the last few days.
