Well, since I havn’t had any brilliant ideas for new content modules recently, and since TCW seems to be lacking in new modules all around, I have decided to step up to the plate and stoop down to creating a Top 25 CD’s I Own list. You can find the list I chose from on the MyTungsten CD List. I will be posting my personal feelings/reviews about each CD and hopefully a little prettiness as well. Here are 5 albums that made the list, in no particular order:

Deltron 3030 – Deltron 3030
Braid – The Age of Octeen
Dan the Automator – Wanna Buy a Monkey?
Dr. Dre – The Chronic
Deftones – White Pony

Check back later this evening for the first part of the list.
