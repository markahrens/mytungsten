I have decided that instead of doing a sign for the game, I can just use Jake as my whiteboard. He is a big guy so we will have him take his shirt off (watch out ladies) and then we need something witty to have written on there. Since the game is on ABC, we need some sort of acronym to work with that. Some suggestions have been:

Always  
Better than  
Cyclones  

and

dAmn  
Boise’s  
Cold  

So throw out your suggestions and I will check this sometime before the game.

I believe my suggestion was

mccArney is a  
Bad  
Caban  

or something like that. It combined the awkward acronym with a dig at ISU and a coach’s misspelled name.

Another  
Big 10  
Co-championship  

Always  
Better than  
Cyclones  

louisianA  
Be  
Crappy  

sabAn  
Bonks  
C-dolphins
