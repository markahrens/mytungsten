This album was highly recommended by a number of people and also commented on when I mentioned I was reviewing it. Unfortunately I cannot see the greatness in this album. Yes Float On is catchy and there are a couple of other surprising songs such as The World At Large and The Good Times are Killing Me, but beyond that I am hard pressed to say there are any other really good songs on the album. That being said, there are plenty of annoying songs, such as Bury Me With It and The Devil’s Workday. The beginning of the album is a little stronger than the end, but as a whole this is more of a 3 song buy. I understand this was a down year for music, but I have to think there have to be much better albums out there.

Review for next week: The Shins - Oh, Inverted World (2001)

I am also accepting recommended albums to review as well, so post any recommendations in the comments area.

You should review The Secret Machines, Now Here is Nowhere.

I forgot to mention that although I disagree with your review of Good News for People Who Love Bad News, I will respect your opinion, even though it sucks. In contrast to your review I feel the end of the albumn is stonger than the beginning. The beginning has a lot of the catchy, happy, poppy songs that will get a lot of play on the radio and MTV, but the end of the albumn takes a bit of a turn, in my opinion, towards the more obscure thought provoking type stuff, which I find more interesting. Listen to in a couple more times, it’ll grow on you.

Matt,

I have listened to the whole album 5 times now and I still cannot get into it. I was really hoping that it would grow on me but for some reason it hasn’t. It is still on my playlist so I will still listen to it occasionally, but I am not too optimistic that I will like it any better. Thanks for the recommendation too, it is on the list of things to get.

Well, I suppose even Luke Skywalker couldn’t harness the power of the force right away, it took much practice. I will act as your own personal Yoda and guide you on your journey. The true musical existence, you, in time, will discover, young Ahrens, that is, Modest Mouse. May THE MOUSE be with you.
