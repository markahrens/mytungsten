This is a fantastic album, for as long as it lasts. Clocking in at 33 minutes, this is not the most lengthy album out there, but luckily the quality of the album more than makes up for the length. This album has a wide variety of styles, but all are keyed with a melodic background. Songs like One By One All Day and New Slang show off group talent. This is my first exposure to the The Shins after a recommendation on AllMusic.com for related artists to Pinback and The American Analog Set. If you are into somewhat mellow rock, this is good stuff for you.

I also recommend this album for “Girl on a Wing” alone.
