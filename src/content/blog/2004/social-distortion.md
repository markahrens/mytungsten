Early 90s punk rock, does it get much better than this? This album is clean, concise and right to the point, hitting you with meaningful lyrics and damn good guitar riffs. Standouts on the album are the cover of Johnny Cash’s Ring of Fire and the SD classic Ball and Chain. In addition to those radio friendly songs, Story of My Life and It Could’ve Been Me are also top notch songs. If you are a bit of a punk historian or just interested in early 90s rock, I would recommend checking this out.
