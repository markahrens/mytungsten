I have different thoughts about this video. First, the technology is cool. Super high definition images allow for the zooming effects in this video without losing any data. While the cameras will be able to capture more than we can see with our eye, the photos that are created can be manipulated so you can see it all. I don’t even want to think about the future storage of this stuff though…

My other thought is about Rio itself. That first shot shows the density of people living so close together. While times I can’t imagine living in a place like that, other times it seems like it would be fascinating to live in a situation so different to what I am in now.
