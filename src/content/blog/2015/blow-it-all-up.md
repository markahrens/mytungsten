Last night I watched the majority of the CONCACAF Cup between Mexico and the US. After the Gold Cup this summer, the friendies and then last night, I am convinced it is time to blow the whole thing up with the National team. Last night I saw a combination of players past their prime who were playing their heart out but just couldn’t keep up, such as Beasley and Beckerman, and players who just didn’t seem interested in playing, like Dempsey and Jones.

The only players that I saw giving any promise for the future were Yedlin and Zardes, which for some reason got subbed for one another. Klinsmann keeps toying with bringing in younger players, but he won’t stick with a consistent anything for them.

We know now that the next major matches the US will have to play are the World Cup qualifiers next month. One of the two matches in November is against Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, so even if we have a young lineup there, we should win that. I think it is time to commit to a youth movement and start building the team we will need in 2018.

And whether Klinsmann is coaching or not, I really don’t care.

Here are some (not all) of the players I would like to see playing:

GK: Hamid, Horvath, Cropper  
DF: Brooks, Shea, Chandler, Besler, Garza, O’Neill  
MF: Yedlin, Trapp, Gil, Ibarra, Mix, Corona, Nagbe, Zelalem  
FW: Jóhannsson, Morris, Green, Zardes, Wood
