<ol>
<li>No Coast - Braid</li>
<li>Our Love - Caribou</li>
<li>Morning Phase - Beck</li>
<li>Syro - Aphex Twin</li>
<li>Atlas - Real Estate</li>
<li>Lost in the Dream - The War on Drugs</li>
<li>Close to the Glass - The Notwist</li>
<li>Afropolitan Dreams - Blitz the Ambassador</li>
<li>Rave Tapes - Mogwai</li>
<li>Reality Testing - Lone</li>

</ol>
