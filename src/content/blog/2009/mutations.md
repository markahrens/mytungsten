Less poppy and more introspective, this is an album for a gray winter day, much like the album cover suggests it might be. That is not to say that the traditional “anything goes” sound of Beck is not featured throughout, it just means that you won’t likely be playing many of the tracks on the dance floor, and that is OK with me.</p>
