<p><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-859" title="cthd" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20131211102330im_/http://mytungsten.net/wp-content//uploads/2009/05/cthd.jpg" alt="cthd" width="150" height="150">A bit of an odd selection, but this soundtrack is actually a really nice example of classical Chinese music. I wonâ€™t say I am an&nbsp;aficionado&nbsp;of Chinese classical music, but I do enjoy it from time to time. This soundtrack is a&nbsp;relatively&nbsp;easy way to experience it rather than trying to troll Amazon for a decent album to check out. If you enjoyed the movie or just want to check out another type of classical music, I would recommend giving this a try.</p>
