<p><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-962" title="giveup" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20131211125417im_/http://mytungsten.net/wp-content//uploads/2009/08/giveup.jpg" alt="giveup" width="150" height="150"> The side project by Ben Gibbard and Jimmy Tamborello is one of the best selling and well known Sub Pop albums of all time, and with good reason. Created by sending tapes across the country through the USPS (clever name huh?), this album fuses Gibbard’s vocals with Tamborello’s electronic music skills amazingly well.</p>

<p>I actually chose this since <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131211125417/http://www.webarnold.net/">Ben Arnold</a> recommended <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131211125417/http://www.owlcitymusic.com/">Owl City</a> to me, after which I had to listen to this instead. Owl City is nice, like way way too nice for my extended listening, but they are definitely fans of The Postal Service.</p>

<p>This album is a bit of a modern classic, if you havn’t given it a listen, I highly recommend it.</p>
