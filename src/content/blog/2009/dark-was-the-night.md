A couple days later than usual, but still before the end of the week, I recommend this compilation of indie rock artists for the Red Hot Organization, which supports HIV and AIDS awareness. Not only this is for a good cause, but it is also a fantastic sampling of many of the artists I like listening to. You get The National, Bon Iver, Arcade Fire and Yo La Tengo, to name a few. 31 tracks total for this double album, I have a feeling this will become the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_Alternative">No Alternative</a> for the current age of music.
