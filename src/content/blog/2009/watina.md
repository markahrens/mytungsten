Watina was an album pick over a year ago when I tried doing it along with the pick of the week, and didn’t quite keep up. After Amazon released their 100 Greatest World Albums yesterday, I thought it appropriate to bring this album back to the front. This really is an amazing album. The music transcends language, allowing you to really feel these songs. If you havn’t checked out an album from a world artist, you could do a lot worse for a first listen.
