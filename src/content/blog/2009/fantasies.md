The newest Metric album took some time to grow on me, but after that, I really enjoyed it. It definitely is influenced by Garbage in the 90s, down to the sassy female lead vocalist, who also happens to steal the album with her talent. The first single, Help Iâ€™m Alive, is a good example of a song that bugged me the first time I heard it, but now I really enjoy, so give it a listen or three before deciding if it is really for you.
