 I realize I might get some flack for this pick, but this is one of the forgotten grunge albums that really stands up after many years. There were a number of hits off this album, with Hey Jealousy being the Gin Blossoms most popular. Listening to the entire album now, it is a little more tame than a lot of grunge albums, but has surprising quality in both the lyrics and music. If you havnâ€™t listened to this album in awhile, give it another check now and decide for yourself how it holds up.
