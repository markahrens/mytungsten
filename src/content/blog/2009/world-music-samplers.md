Last week I mentioned that Amazon posted their top 100 world music albums and that they also have about<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131211125417/http://www.amazon.com/gp/feature.html/ref=amb_link_85128851_4?ie=UTF8&amp;docId=1000410281&amp;pf_rd_m=ATVPDKIKX0DER&amp;pf_rd_s=right-4&amp;pf_rd_r=1QBVR4509PFGGMZC355J&amp;pf_rd_t=1401&amp;pf_rd_p=486714211&amp;pf_rd_i=1000416151"> 27 world music samplers</a>. I have given a number a listen, so I thought this week I would recommend a few, so here goes:

<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131211125417/http://www.amazon.com/Degrees-Free-Indian-Music-Sampler/dp/B0029S0TBG/ref=amb_link_84387851_3?pf_rd_m=ATVPDKIKX0DER&amp;pf_rd_s=center-1&amp;pf_rd_r=1CFC9E9BNNNSX7HX406S&amp;pf_rd_t=1401&amp;pf_rd_p=477953891&amp;pf_rd_i=1000377831">Six Degrees Free</a> – As collection of Indian music, it would be easy to say that this is just riding the momentum of Slumdog Millionaire, but the songs on the sampler show a greater range of Indian music. Journey by Bombay Dub Orchestra would be my recommendation if you only want to listen to one song.

<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131211125417/http://www.amazon.com/Luaka-Bop-Orinoco-Sampler/dp/B002DESNG4/ref=amb_link_85072891_18?pf_rd_m=ATVPDKIKX0DER&amp;pf_rd_s=center-3&amp;pf_rd_r=0JX2C7HC9T4WMWYT57XC&amp;pf_rd_t=1401&amp;pf_rd_p=489514111&amp;pf_rd_i=1000410281">Luaka Bop</a> – World artists from all over here, so there is a decent chance you will find something you like. As a bonus, there is a remix of Wherever You Are by Geggy Tah. My one song on this one is Valentin by Susana Baca.

<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131211125417/http://www.amazon.com/Rotana-Presents-Music-Middle-East/dp/B002KX0IJS/ref=amb_link_85169371_3?pf_rd_m=ATVPDKIKX0DER&amp;pf_rd_s=right-1&amp;pf_rd_r=02CBDDN508BEZY8A6ZNT&amp;pf_rd_t=1401&amp;pf_rd_p=488645211&amp;pf_rd_i=1000418661">Rotana</a> – With music from the Middle East, I realize this might be a stretch for some, but I really enjoyed it. My pick on this one is Kalamak Ya Habibi by George Wassouf

Let me know if you checked out any others and if you have anything you would recommend as well.

PS: It is things like this that make the Amazon MP3 store better than iTunes at this point.
