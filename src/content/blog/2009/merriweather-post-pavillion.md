<p>It should come as no surprise to anyone following <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131211065127/http://twitter.com/mizidymizark">my tweets</a> that I chose this album this week.&nbsp; This album is one of those albums that is good the first time you hear it and then gets better with each following listen.&nbsp; If anything, you could put *My Girls* on repeat for days and it still wouldnâ€™t get old.</p>
