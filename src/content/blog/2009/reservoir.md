The album bops up and down throughout, but stays with a consistent sound, kept together by the lyrical stylings. And the best part is, you can get this fantastic album for a buck until July 4th from the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131211082208/http://www.fanfarlo.com/">band’s web site.</a> Really, you can’t afford not to check this band out and support a fantastic way for the band to get money directly.</p>
