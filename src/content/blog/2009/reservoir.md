One part Arcade Fire, the other Beirut, this album by the Swedish band Fanfarlo is going to be another of this year’s top albums. The album bops up and down throughout, but stays with a consistent sound, kept together by the lyrical stylings. And the best part is, you can get this fantastic album for a buck until July 4th from the <a href="http://www.fanfarlo.com/">band’s web site.</a> Really, you can’t afford not to check this band out and support a fantastic way for the band to get money directly.
