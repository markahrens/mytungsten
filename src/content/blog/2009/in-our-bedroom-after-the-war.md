<p><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-800" title="In Our Bedroom After the War" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20131211115525im_/http://mytungsten.net/wp-content//uploads/2009/02/inourbedroomafterthewar.jpg" alt="In Our Bedroom After the War" width="150" height="150">This is an album from 2007 that I found out about after I made my top ten list, which is why it was not on there. This is a fantastic album and one of the best examples of a male/female vocal duo out there. The play between the two lyrical stylings is almost perfect, accenting each other throughout. Add in quality instrumental work and you have catchy album that isnâ€™t too poppy, but is accessible by a wide audience.</p>
