<p><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-836" title="March of the Zapotec &amp; Realpeople: Holland" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20131211115525im_/http://mytungsten.net/wp-content//uploads/2009/02/zapotecbeirut.jpg" alt="March of the Zapotec &amp; Realpeople: Holland" width="150" height="150">This weekâ€™s album is a collection of 2 EPs from Beirut. The first EP is a collection of songs written by Beirut, performed by a Zapotec band in Mexico. This means you will get the full 20 piece band, full of horns, playing through the unique stylings of Beirut. This in itself is worth it for me, but then you get something totally different with the second EP. This is a collection of mellow electronic rock that is relatively well done. Good stuff all around again by Beirut.</p>
