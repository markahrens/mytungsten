Los Angeles from Flying Lotus is a good electronic album from 2008. More animated than the last few electronic albums I recommended, this one has more texture throughout and might be up your alley if the others were not. There is a lot going on with each song, so you have to be a bit of an active listener here. If you are, you will be rewarded though.
