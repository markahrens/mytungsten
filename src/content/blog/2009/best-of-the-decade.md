<p>While it has been some time since I have posted, I have been thinking of my blog and what I would like to post on it. Since I have been doing the “best of” lists the last two years, and it is less and less likely that I will be able to keep up with much new music this year, I had to think of a different “big” project that I could actually accomplish. After some time I decided on a best albums of the decade list. </p>

<p>I already have some ideas of albums for the list, but as always I enjoy hearing recommendations from others. Since there are a lot of fantastic albums from the last 9 1/2 years, I am sure I missed some. Also since I have less time to post, I want to get started early so help a guy out and toss me some suggestions! </p>
