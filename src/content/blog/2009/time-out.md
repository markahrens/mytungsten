I inquired through Twitter and Facebook about getting into jazz. While I was met with some <a href="http://stuffwhitepeoplelike.com/2008/11/18/116-black-music-that-black-people-dont-listen-to-anymore/">sass</a>, I did get some helpful suggestions, one of which was this classic. Of the suggestions, this is the first that really spoke to me, so I figured I would give some props to <a href="http://www.othertime.com/musicblog/">Mr. Wilson</a> for the recommendation and say that it is fantastic. It is also good timing, as it is at itâ€™s 50 year anniversary, which includes a nice <a href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=105322899&amp;sc=fb&amp;cc=fp">write up from NPR</a> about the album.
