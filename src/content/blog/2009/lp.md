<p><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-946" title="lpdiscovery" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20131211162732im_/http://mytungsten.net/wp-content//uploads/2009/07/lpdiscovery.jpg" alt="lpdiscovery" width="150" height="150">A side project featuring a member of Vampire Weekend (Rostam Batmanglij) and a member of Ra Ra Riot (Wes Miles), this takes the sounds of each band and rams them through the electro-pop/Auto-Tune machine and produces something that is different but not all bad. While the entire album isn’t fantastic, and at times I can’t tell if they are mocking the Auto-Tune, there are some gems that can be pulled out.</p>

<p>The first song that really caught me was Can You Discover?, basically a redesigned version of Ra Ra Riot’s Can You Tell (a song I love). As you progress through the album, you find songs like Carby, auto-tuned to the MAX but still decent nonetheless. The top song is the remake of the Jackson 5′s I Want You Back.</p>
