A side project featuring a member of Vampire Weekend (Rostam Batmanglij) and a member of Ra Ra Riot (Wes Miles), this takes the sounds of each band and rams them through the electro-pop/Auto-Tune machine and produces something that is different but not all bad. While the entire album isn’t fantastic, and at times I can’t tell if they are mocking the Auto-Tune, there are some gems that can be pulled out.

The first song that really caught me was Can You Discover?, basically a redesigned version of Ra Ra Riot’s Can You Tell (a song I love). As you progress through the album, you find songs like Carby, auto-tuned to the MAX but still decent nonetheless. The top song is the remake of the Jackson 5′s I Want You Back.
