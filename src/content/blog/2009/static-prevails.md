This is the Jimmy Eat World album before they got recognized which was before they hit it big. This is a quality late 90s emo album that brings a little less refined sound than the current Jimmy Eat World. If you are a fan of their work, I recommend checking this out so you can see where they got started. Listening to each of their albums in a row really shows that while they have grown some, they were pretty darn good to begin with too.
