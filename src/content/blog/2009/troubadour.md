Troubadour is the first hip-hop album that I have really enjoyed in awhile. My tastes have changed, but this album speaks a little more about real problems with the world and a lot less about guns and drugs. The highlight of this album is Wavin’ Flag, talking about the struggle in Somolia, K’naan’s home country. This is a theme throughout the album, but does not overpower. This is one that will be talked about for a number of years
