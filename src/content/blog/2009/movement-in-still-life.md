Movement in Still Life by BT is one of those early decade electronic albums that can actually still stand on itâ€™s own merit. While there is some cheesy electronic beats on some of the songs, it is worth looking past to find some fantastic tracks, such as Dreaming and Satellite. If have the need to relive some beats but not feel ashamed doing it, check this album out.
