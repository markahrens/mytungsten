A bit lengthy at times, this album can wonder around some. That being said, it has one of my favorite songs on it, *Four Winds*. It is a great example of the depth of Conor Oberst’s musical talent and lyrical stylings as well. While not as accessable as some artists, this is worth a listen or two because you might just love it.</p>
