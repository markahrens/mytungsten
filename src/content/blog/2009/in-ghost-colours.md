In Ghost Colours by Cut Copy is another in the string of electronic albums that I have been checking out lately. Reminding me a little of Caribou but with a still unique style, this is an album that will treat you if you pay attention, but is still fantastic for background music. It is diverse enough in the sound that it will not bore you, which is also a nice thing. Hearts on Fire is a particularly strong track if you want to check out a song before getting the whole album.
