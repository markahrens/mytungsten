With sounds that could be out of the 60s, this album hits is in every possible way. While I could go on about the arrangement and how the instrument work is perfect for this style of album, it is really the vocals that make this fantastic. Tracyanne Campbell brings something amazing to this album by Camera Obscura that can only really be experienced to appreciate.
