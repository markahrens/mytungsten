The latest from Phoenix (apparently a French super group) is one of the better albums of the year and also happens to be a great summer album. Tons of fun, while also having a lot of quality as well, this is one of those albums that you can listen to on repeat while driving around with the windows down. My only complaint is that it is a bit short.
