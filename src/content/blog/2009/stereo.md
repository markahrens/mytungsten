<p><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-790" title="Stereo - Christie Front Drive" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20131211065127im_/http://mytungsten.net/wp-content//uploads/2009/01/cfd_stereo.jpg" alt="Stereo - Christie Front Drive" width="150" height="150"> Stereo is one of my favorite albums of all time, both for the quality of the album and the sentimental memories it stirs in me. Basically I got into emo in 97 due to some friends at NIU who ended up not treating me the finest. While that part sucked, the music was still fantastic and I bought this album at one of the coolest shows I ever went to.</p>

<p>I bought the album on the recommendation of someone more in the know about emo that I was at a show for the Get-Up Kids opening for Braid in front of 150 people. While the Get-Up Kids became more popular in later years, this was my one chance to be the the guy “that saw them before they got big”.</p>

<p>While those memories are great, this album is also just fantastic with melodies and lyric styling years ahead of it’s time. It can be a little rough around the edges, but this is what emo really should have been. Does this date me? Sure, but it is still an album worth sharing and recommending 10 years later.</p>
