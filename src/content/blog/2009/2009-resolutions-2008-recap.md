Before giving out my 2009 resolutions, I thought I would recap my 2008 ones:

<h3>Tech (Work or Home)</h3>

<ul>

<li>**Completed**! – Finish Help Desk Projects – There are a number of Help Desk web projects in progress right now so getting some done would be great.</li>

<li>**Completed**! – Become a SharePoint programming whiz – I have a feeling that SharePoint is going to be more and more popular on campus with some need for custom uses, so becoming better at SP programming will be very useful</li>

<li>**Pretty darn close, 49 picks were written almost on time** – Write a blog article each week called “Service/Software of the Week” that highlights a service or piece of software.</li>

</ul>

<h3>Personal Life</h3>

<ul>

<li>**Completed**! – Take a Trip Somewhere – Less specific than San Fran trip, but I would like to go somewhere</li>

<li>**Completed**! – Finish Painting inside the House – More than halfway there with the first day of the year, just gotta finish up two areas of the house</li>

<li>**Completed**! – Put a ceiling fan in the bedroom – I like ceiling fans</li>

<li>**Completed**! – Try and fix the backyard – It is a wreck and I would like to get some forward momentum with it</li>

<li>**Not Quite ☹️** – Exercise more – I don’t do much at all now for exercise so I want to start getting in better shape</li>

</ul>

<h3>Stuff Stuff</h3>

<ul>

<li>**Completed**! – Second Car</li>

</ul>

That is pretty good in my opinion, I guess that happens when you set reasonable goals.

Now for my new resolutions.&nbsp; I have to say that with the total unknown of how my life will really change once Will is born, these are going to either be easily achievable or way over my head.

<ul>

<li>Exercise more – Other than snow shoveling last year, I didn’t get much done.&nbsp; Not sure how it will work out with a kid coming soon, but it is still a good goal.</li>

<li>Be a parent – Not just being a Dad, but baring extra responsibility to help Rebekah stay sane and have quality time with Will.</li>

<li>See 3 movies in the theater</li>

<li>Finish one novel a month (First I have to find a novel each month, but we shall see)</li>

<li>Keep up my blog at a reasonable pace – Leaving out the end of the year lists, I had almost 100 posts through the year.&nbsp; I would like to keep up about that pace.&nbsp; Something that should help is:</li>

<li>Album of the Week – Replacing the Pick of the Week will be an Album of the Week.&nbsp; Current or from the past, I will pick an album each week to recommend.</li>

<li>Write more about music – If the Top 10 Lists showed anything, my traffic goes up when I write about music, so I will work on writing more about music.</li>

</ul>

That about covers it, we will see how it goes! Happy New Year to everyone of course and hope you will keep reading throughout 2009.
