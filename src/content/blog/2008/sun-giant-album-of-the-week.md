I am cheating this week with only an EP, but people need to hear the band Fleet Foxes in any way possible.&nbsp; Unfortunately until their album comes out, this is the only way possible.&nbsp; Using lots of reverb mixed with soothing vocals, this will be 20 minutes of joy for you.&nbsp; As an added bonus, it is available on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131211172857/http://www.amazon.com/Sun-Giant-EP/dp/B0016OCMB4/ref=pd_bbs_sr_2?ie=UTF8&amp;s=dmusic&amp;qid=1208399619&amp;sr=8-2">Amazon MP3</a> for just $2.99.&nbsp; If you like music and have 3 bucks, I emplore you to check this out.&nbsp; I don’t think you will be disappointed.

*Album of the Week is my way of highlighting albums both new and old that I think are worth checking out.&nbsp; You can find an archive of services and software at <a href="/web/20131211172857/http://mytungsten.net/2008/2008/04/10/tag/aotw">http://www.marktopia.net/tag/aotw/</a>. *
