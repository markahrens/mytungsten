<p>The obvious pick for last week is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131211125408/http://www.google.com/chrome/">Google Chrome</a>.&nbsp; Windows-only for now, but still an impressive first step into the browser world by Google.&nbsp; It is really really fast, so that earns the pick by itself.&nbsp; I also like the home page where it shows 9 commonly visited sites with a search and bookmarks collection right there.&nbsp; I also like the “Omnibar” which functions as both the address bar and search box.&nbsp; The browser looks clean and the V8 javascript engine really is amazing.&nbsp; I will let <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131211125408/http://www.google.com/googlebooks/chrome/index.html">the comic</a> explain more about the technology if you want to know more.</p>
