On my 6 month recap, there was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131211120824/http://www.marktopia.net/#comment-2033">a commenter</a> that said they has been diaapponted by the new Death Cab for Cutie album, Narrow Stairs.  Now I have not been a big Death Cab fan and have actually just recently really investigated there past catalog, so I have a different perspective than there long time listeners.  That does afford me an interesting opportunity though, where I can make the case for the album to both new and old listeners of the band.

I dare say this is the top Death Cab album, however I doubt many long time fans will agree.&nbsp; I think the quality of the music is just as good as their previous albums, it is the content and establishment of the songs that works well for me.&nbsp; Take the first single, I Will Possess Your Heart.&nbsp; It runs with a 4 minute instrumental intro before getting to the lyrics of a jadded admirer turned stalker.&nbsp; The 4 minute intro can be read as the normal persuit of a lover, escalating to when the lyrics kick in at which point the person is now a stalker and fully creepy.

Almost more haunting is Grapevine Fires which initially sounds like a family escaping the seasonal fires in California, but on further listens could be the arsonist admiring his work from afar.&nbsp; The album just aches with common and not so common troubles of the Gen X population living in California.&nbsp; Does it get a bit drab at times, sure, but this is where the quality of the music really lifts the album up to be really fantastic.&nbsp; If you have not listened or have given up on the album, I encourage you to take another listen.&nbsp; You might just find something there that you were not expecting.
