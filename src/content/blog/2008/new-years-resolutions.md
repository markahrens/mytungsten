<p>Another year gone so it is time to review last year’s resolutions and come up with some new ones for the coming year.  First, here is the listing of last year’s resolutions and their status.  Then later this evening or tomorrow, I will be posting the 2008 resolutions.</p>

<p>Tech (Work or Home)</p>

<ul>

<li>Learn ASP.NET – This will be useful at work and in the long term. **Completed**

</li>

<li>Continue tweaking the Comics Database – To keep up with my main Rails experience, I figure I should keep tweaking the program if there are places that could use improvement. **Changed – See below**

</li>

<li>Develop Coffee Database – As some of you may remember, I once had a listing of all the beers I tried. It was all done with static pages and since I quit drinking before I started messing with databases, it didn’t make much sense to migrate it to one. Now I drink coffee, and my sense of curiosity for trying new coffees is similiar to my beer drinking, this seems like a basic/fun application **Not completed**

</li>

<li>Install Leopard and make my own widget – This one is more for fun, however finishing the goal of a Help Desk Outages widget would be cool **Kind of Completed**

</li>

<li>Finish new Help Desk Outages stuff – This project has been started already, but knowing how priorities change at work, I want to make sure this gets done **Not completed**</li>

</ul>

<p>Personal Life (Not that kinda personal)</p>

<ul>

<li>Pay off some loans – Being in debt isn’t that much fun, so paying off a couple of loans this year would be good. Rebekah and I are on track to do this, so baring some major change, it shouldn’t be a problem. **Completed**

</li>

<li>Start saving for a house – This starts happening after the above resolution. **Completed, and More! See below**

</li>

<li>Take a trip to San Francisco – This one falls under the maybe category, but I love San Fran and Rebekah has never been there. **Not completed**

</li>

<li>Drink 64 oz of water every day – I need to get healthier and water will help. Nuff details about that for now. **Completed**</li>

</ul>

<p>Social Stuff</p>

<ul>

<li>Take a class – This is wide open. Rebekah and I started taking a ballroom class right before the wedding. It was a bit intense and a lot too close to the wedding, but it did get me interested in taking some sort of class, maybe photography. **Not completed**</li>

</ul>

<p>Stuff Stuff (List of expensive things that I want)</p>

<ul>

<li>Nintendo Wii **Completed**

</li>

<li>Second car **Not completed**

</li>

<li>Digital SLR **Completed**

</li>

<li>High Def TV **Completed**</li>

</ul>

<p>Note about the Comics Database – Soon after the beginning of the year, I found a web site <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131211162729/http://www.stashmycomics.com/">StashMyComics</a> that did pretty much what I wanted to for free.  It isn’t perfect and can be a little slow, however it has worked for now.</p>

<p>Note about House Savings – Rebekah and I bought a house, it is that simple and that cool!</p>
