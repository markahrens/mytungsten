<p>Even though I am on vacation, I have postdated this entry as not to miss the Pick of the Week.&nbsp; Luckily for you the reader, this is possible using said Pick of the Week.&nbsp; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131211172857/http://www.wordpress.org/">WordPress</a> has been my blogging software of choice for about 3 years now (with a slight interruption during the Drupal kick I had).&nbsp; WordPress has both hosted and self maintained versions of their software that allows you to manage a blog through a web based interface.&nbsp; I won’t go into all of the details as their web site does a better job of that.&nbsp; What I want to comment on is the new version that came out this week.</p>

<p>Version 2.5 doesn’t change much for the end user, but it does make administration of your site much easier.&nbsp; The admin panel is well organized now and little things with the Write section really make a difference.&nbsp; You can also manage the design of your site easily, even editing the CSS if you have the permissions set correctly on the server.&nbsp; If you are running a blog and looking for a new content management system, I would highly recommend WordPress.</p>

<p>*Pick of the Week is my way of highlighting cool/new services and software on the web or the Mac. A few Windows applications might sneak in from time to time, but it will be rare. You can find an archive of services and software at <a href="/web/20131211172857/http://mytungsten.net/2008/tag/potw/">http://www.marktopia.net/tag/potw/</a>.*</p>
