Today we are in another Winter Storm Warning with potential for freezing rain and 4-8 inches of snow.&nbsp; Because I am about at my wits end with winter, I am going to make my own prediction.&nbsp; It is going to rain, washing away some of the crap on the roads.&nbsp; When it will be getting cold enough for snow, we will hit the dry wedge in the storm and just get a few flurries.&nbsp; That is my prediction, I am sticking to it.
