Back after a one week break, this week I have <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131211095312/http://www.piclens.com/">PicLens</a> as my recommendation.&nbsp; An add-on for most popular browsers and works on both Mac and Windows.&nbsp; It allows you to get a slick view of pictures on sites such as Flickr and Facebook, in addition to videos on YouTube.&nbsp; They are adding new sites all the time and have information on how you can add your site to it as well.&nbsp; It is free of charge, and hopefully won’t cost money right after I write this like the pick of the week two weeks ago.

*Pick of the Week is my way of highlighting cool/new services and software on the web or the Mac. A few Windows applications might sneak in from time to time, but it will be rare. You can find an archive of services and software at <a href="/web/20131211095312/http://mytungsten.net/2008/2008/04/04/tag/potw">http://www.marktopia.net/tag/potw/</a>.*
