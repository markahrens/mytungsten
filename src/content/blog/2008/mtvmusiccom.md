When I was growing up, MTV used to play a lot of music videos, unlike the zero they play now.&nbsp; In a twist of fate, MTV released a web site that now collects a lot videos, both older and new. Completely legal and not going to be taken down, like YouTube can, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131211165801/http://www.mtvmusic.com/">MTVMusic.com</a> is a fantastic way to check out music videos for free.
