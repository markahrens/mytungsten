<p>When I got my Rebel XT, I took an initial look at both Lightroom and Aperture to help manage and edit my RAW images.&nbsp; After some testing with both, I settled on Aperture and even made it a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131211172915/http://www.marktopia.net/2008/02/02/aperture-pick-of-the-week/">POTW</a> awhile back.&nbsp; I was very excited a couple of weeks ago when Apple released Aperture 2.0.&nbsp; It didn’t have the HDR stuff I was looking for, but that was OK, they made it faster and seemingly better.&nbsp; In fact, everything was better with the exception of the pricing they put out.&nbsp; See, Aperture 1.x was $300 for retail but $150 for individual education pricing, or 50% off for those math gurus out there.&nbsp; With Aperture 2.0, Apple knocked down the retail price to $200 but RAISED the individual education price to $180, 10% off now.&nbsp; Because of this, I decided to take a second look at Lightroom, which is priced at $100 for individual education pricing.</p>

<p>Before getting started discussing the two programs features, I should note that both are great programs.&nbsp; You could use either and be perfectly happy.&nbsp; That being said, I have decided to make the switch to Lightroom after doing some more indepth testing and having better knowledge of my camera and editing pictures.&nbsp; The biggest difference between the two programs is workflow.&nbsp; In Aperture, there is no real workflow.&nbsp; You can edit pictures, metadata, etc from the same screen.&nbsp; This was great when I was starting out as I didn’t really know what I wanted to do.&nbsp; With experience though, I am able to be confined into a workflow chosen for me, especially the one that Lightroom has setup.</p>

<p>When jumping into Lightroom, you start with your Library where you can do things like make collections, add keywords, stack photos, etc.&nbsp; I should quickly note, adding keywords in Lightroom is MUCH easier than Aperture, which is another reason I switched.&nbsp; After doing organization stuff, one switches to the Develop section where you can do all your edits.&nbsp; Aperture 2.0 has caught up to the different editing features, but as one who was using Aperture 1.5, Lightroom has an impressive array of tools that I didn’t have before.&nbsp; After Developing, you have three ways you can share your pictures, Slideshow, Web Album and Printing.&nbsp; You can also do a basic export, for example to get things up to Flickr.&nbsp; Being open to this idea of workflow, I was able to jump into Lightroom and go.&nbsp; For me it just works easier than Aperture, so I made the switch.&nbsp; I would be interested to get other thoughts from people who have used either or both applications to see what they think.</p>
