<p>If you are an <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131211165837/http://www.npr.org/">NPR</a> listener, you are likely familiar with the program All Things Considered.&nbsp; Another program from NPR you may not be familiar with though is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131211165837/http://www.npr.org/templates/rundowns/rundown.php?prgId=37">All Songs Considered</a>.&nbsp; All Songs Considered is hosted by Bob Boilen and covers, quite literally, the world of music.&nbsp; I have been introduced to a number of great artists already and I have only been listening for a couple of months now.</p>

<p>All Songs Considered is also easy to find since it is done through podcast so you just need to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131211165837/http://www.npr.org/rss/podcast/podcast_detail.php?siteId=4819413&amp;ps=mpm">subscribe</a> to check it out.&nbsp; It is free of charge of course which makes it even cooler because you get to listen to full songs on the podcast almost every week.&nbsp; If you are looking for an episode to start with, I recommend the Listeners Picks of the Year from 12/20/2007.&nbsp; It has a song from each of the top 25 listeners albums of the year.&nbsp; That episode got me hooked and I have looked forward to each episode since.</p>

<p>*Pick of the Week is my way of highlighting cool/new services and software on the web or the Mac. A few Windows applications might sneak in from time to time, but it will be rare. You can find an archive of services and software at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131211165837/http://www.marktopia.net/tag/potw/">http://www.marktopia.net/tag/potw/</a>.*</p>
