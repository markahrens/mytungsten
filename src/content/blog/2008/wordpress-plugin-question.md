For those of you out there that use WordPress, do you use many plugins? I have a few on my site, but have been looking at a few more potentially.&nbsp; If you have a lot of plugins (more than 5) do you notice a performance hit? Do you find them valuable? Do you run into problems when upgrading WordPress? Related to that, are there any plugins that you have to have installed? The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131211105408/http://anthologyoi.com/awp">AJAXed WordPress</a> plugin is that way for me, although some of the features of it will be part of 2.7. Feel free to comment about your plugin experiences.
