The longest and angriest album on the list, is probably the most dense with music as well.&nbsp; Every track on this album is layered upon layer of sound, most of the time leading to greatness.&nbsp; The album starts off by bombarding you with this sound on Halfway Home and continues through tracks like Family Tree and Shout Me Out.&nbsp; One of the more intense and hard hitting tracks is DLZ which sounds like a less than polite oath to the current president. But as angry as the album can be, the final track, Lovers Day, shows some optimism, and that is what helps move this album up the list.
