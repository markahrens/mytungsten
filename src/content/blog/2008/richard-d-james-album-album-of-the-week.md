<p>To some, this is a no brainer, but for those of you who have not heard the Richard D. James Album by Aphex Twin, you owe yourself a favor to do so right now.&nbsp; If you like electronic music at all, even in passing, check out this album because it is a masterpiece of electronic music.&nbsp; Aphex Twin somehow makes seemingly random noises come together in a harmony that is just amazing.&nbsp; I could keep saying more about it, but that would be wasting time you should be getting and listening to this.&nbsp; Enjoy!</p>

<p>*Album of the Week is my way of highlighting albums both new and old that I think are worth checking out.&nbsp; You can find an archive of services and software at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131211172915/http://www.marktopia.net/tag/aotw">http://www.marktopia.net/tag/aotw/</a>.&nbsp;*</p>
