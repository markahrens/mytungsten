<p>Who doesn’t like quality British pop music?&nbsp; I know I do, and therefore I share Twelve Stops and Home by The Feeling.&nbsp; It came out a couple years ago and was very popular in England, but didn’t do so well here.&nbsp; It is a poppy album that doesn’t take itself too seriously, but still succeeds in being well worth listening to.&nbsp; My top picks from the album are Sewn and Fill My Little World, if you are looking just to try a couple of songs, however the entire album is good so give it a whirl.</p>

<p>*Album of the Week is my way of highlighting albums both new and old that I think are worth checking out.&nbsp; You can find an archive of services and software at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131211165837/http://www.marktopia.net/tag/aotw">http://www.marktopia.net/tag/aotw/</a>.&nbsp; *</p>
