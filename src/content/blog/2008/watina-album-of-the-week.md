<p>Due to the positive response the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131211162729/http://www.marktopia.net/tag/potw">Pick of the Week</a> has received, I have decided to also add an <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131211162729/http://www.marktopia.net/tag/aotw">Album of the Week</a> feature.&nbsp; My plan is to do the pick on Friday/Saturdays and the albums on Wednesdays.&nbsp; Also thanks to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131211162729/http://imshane.com/">Shane</a> for his recommendation to move the about text to the bottom of each post.</p>

<p>This week I want to expose an album that I found out about through the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131211162729/http://npr.org/">NPR</a> podcast <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131211162729/http://www.npr.org/templates/rundowns/rundown.php?prgId=37">All Songs Considered</a>.&nbsp; Watina is an album by Andy Palacio of Balize.&nbsp; Actually Andy passed away recently which is one of the reasons this album was mentioned on the show.&nbsp; It is an unfortunate thing because Watina shows an amazing amount of skill and beauty.&nbsp; Admittedly, I don’t understand the language being spoken but the meaning and feeling of each song comes through loud and clear through the use of the guitar and percussion.</p>

<p>If the prospect of listening to a foreign language album, I would recommend checking out Gaganbadiba (Take Advice) or Amunegu (In Times To Come) as they will give you a good sense of what the rest of the album is like.&nbsp;&nbsp; The album is available through <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131211162729/http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewCollaboration?ids=4115965-215180520&amp;s=143441">iTunes</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131211162729/http://www.amazon.com/W%C3%A1tina/dp/B000W0A990/ref=pd_bbs_sr_2?ie=UTF8&amp;s=dmusic&amp;qid=1201743390&amp;sr=8-2">Amazon</a> or <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131211162729/http://www.emusic.com/album/Andy-Palacio-W%C3%A1tina-MP3-Download/11015875.html">eMusic</a>.</p>

<p>*Album of the Week is my way of highlighting albums both new and old that I think are worth checking out.&nbsp; You can find an archive of services and software at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131211162729/http://www.marktopia.net/tag/aotw">http://www.marktopia.net/tag/aotw/</a>. *</p>
