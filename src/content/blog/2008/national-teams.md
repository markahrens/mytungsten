<h3>World Cup</h3>

Even the most casual sports person is probably aware of the World Cup.&nbsp; The World Cup is held every 4 years with the winner being crowned the top national team in the world with the last champion being Italy in 2006.&nbsp; National teams are comprised only of players from that nation, much like an Olympic team.&nbsp; Also like the Olympics, the location moves throughout the world.&nbsp; The 2010 World Cup will be hosted in South Africa.

What some people may not know is that the World Cup tournament, or final, is preceded by World Cup qualifying.&nbsp; The qualifying starts about 2 and a half years before the final and is broken into the different regions of the world, Europe, Africa, Asia &amp; Oceania, South America and North, Central America &amp; the Caribbean.&nbsp; Each region has a different number of teams able to qualify.&nbsp; Each region also uses different processes to qualify for the final tournament.

<h3>Regional Tournaments</h3>

In addition to the World Cup, each region also hosts tournaments for national teams.&nbsp; An example of this is the UEFA European Football Championships, also known as the EURO.&nbsp; Each region decides the frequency of their tournaments separately.
