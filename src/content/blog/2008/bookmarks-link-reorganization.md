For those of you subscribed to my <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131211125405/http://del.icio.us/mizidymizark">del.icio.us</a> feed, I apologize for two reasons.&nbsp; First off, I apologize because there has been no activity on it for months and months.&nbsp; Second, I apologize because you got bombarded with a bunch of stuff today.&nbsp; All of this was due to my new organization for bookmarks and stuff to read.&nbsp; I had been gathering links all over the place, Firefox, NetNewsWireâ€™s flagged items, old del.icio.us links, etc.&nbsp;&nbsp; This made it difficult to figure out where stuff was and what I had read already.&nbsp; I decided to put everything together on del.icio.us now.&nbsp; Stuff I have read and want bookmarked will get thrown up there for everyone to see and stuff I have not have had a chance to read yet will get the clever <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131211125405/http://del.icio.us/mizidymizark/toread">toread</a> tag on it.&nbsp; If you are curious about stuff I am reading or going to read, feel free to follow them.
