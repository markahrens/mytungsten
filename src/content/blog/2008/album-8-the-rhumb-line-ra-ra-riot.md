<p>Both “big” Afro/Chamber rock albums, this one and Vampire Weekend, are pretty darn good. While Vampire Weekend got more press, The Rhumb Line has a more sophisticated sound that is not as catchy, but sounds better overall. Suffering a death in the band during the creation of the record, the folks in Ra Ra Riot banded together (pardon the pun) and finished the release.</p>

<p>The real success of this album is the mix of the poppy beat with string instruments coming together so flawlessly. Mix in some fantastic lyrics, including taking on an e.e. cummings poem on Death is Fine, and you have one of the best albums of the year.</p>
