I let the Album of the Week go awhile back because of time and I didn’t make it a resolution for the new year so I didn’t feel obligated to do it.&nbsp; I also felt guilty with my last design where only one post showed up that it would not get displayed long out there.&nbsp; With the new design, I figured I could play catch up with the album of the week.&nbsp; I am still unlikely to post every week, but I will try to do a few albums a month for you.&nbsp; In the meantime, I will suggest an album for each week since April 16th, the last Album of the Week

**April 23: Know by Heart – The American Analog Set**

I once told <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131211125405/http://www.asstastic.org/">Mattbot</a> that I would like to listen to some new music and he obliged with a bunch of artists I had never heard of.&nbsp; One of my favorites was the this album.&nbsp; Softly sung but strong lyrics infiltrate this entire album.

**April 30: Hello Rockview – Less Than Jake**

A flashback to my short punk/ska days, this album is still a great listen for a little angst with your horns.

**May 7: Mary Star of the Sea – Zwan**

While I did not love the album by the new Smashing Pumpkins last year, I did love the more obscure album by Zwan, Billy Corgan’s band between Pumpkins stints.&nbsp; It is meant to be listened to loudly, and I would encourage doing that.

**May 14: Rodrigo y Gabriela – Rodrigo y Gabriela**

A guitar instrumental album, this is simply amazing.&nbsp; I don’t need to say more, just check it out.

**May 21: Dial “M” for Monkey – Bonobo**

Nice relaxed electronic music that is interesting enough to keep you listening, but also works as great background music.

**May 28: Narrow Stairs – Death Cab for Cutie**

I decided to buy this even after I couldn’t find someone who recommended it.&nbsp; It is a little darker than other Death Cab albums but also a little more entertaining.

**June 4: Fleet Foxes – Fleet Foxes**

This shouldn’t be a surprise to anyone since I loved the EP so much.&nbsp; This will likely be one of the contenders for album of the year.

**June 11: Rook – Shearwater**

If you like Okkervil River, you will love this album.&nbsp; Will Shelf, the vocalist for Okkervil River, lends his talents to Shearwater once again to make one of the most touching and powerful albums of the year.

**June 18: Yankee Hotel Foxtrot – Wilco**

For most people, this will need no explanation.&nbsp; That being said, this album had to grow on me, but when it did, it has become one of my favorite albums ever.

**June 25: Deltron 3030 – Deltron 3030**

An obscure hip-hop album from the year 2000 was re-released with a few more remixes making it an even better value.&nbsp; This album is set in the 3030 and has sci-fi themes throughout.&nbsp; For a nerd, hip-hop doesn’t get much better.

**July 2: Ghost Rock – Nomo**

To commemorate Jazz Fest in Iowa City, I give you a kind of funky jazz sounding album from Nomo.&nbsp; If you arn’t sure, check out the track Rings as it will give you a good sense of what the rest of the album is like.
