Even with cancelled flights and severe weather, I am managing to post an album of the week.&nbsp; This week we have Hunky Dory by David Bowie. This is partly inspired by my watching of the BBC series Life on Mars, but this is a fantastic album from start to finish.&nbsp; I realize that most people are already aware of this, but I am a little late to the party on this one.&nbsp; In any case, the variety in styles of music combined with Bowie’s unique voice help make this album really stand out.&nbsp; Sorry about the short post, but use the time you would have been reading listening to this.

*Album of the Week is my way of highlighting albums both new and old that I think are worth checking out.&nbsp; You can find an archive of services and software at <a href="/web/20131211172857/http://mytungsten.net/2008/tag/aotw">http://www.marktopia.net/tag/aotw/</a>. *
