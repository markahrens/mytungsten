<p>Once again, Marktopia has a new design with some changes to the way some stuff was done with the organization of the site as well.&nbsp; The first thing I want to do is give credit to PSHero.com for their <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131211162734/http://pshero.com/archives/interstate-road-sign/">Interstate Road Sign tutorial</a> in Photoshop.&nbsp; The wonderful detail it gave set the theme for the new design and allowed me to add more texture to the site.</p>

<p>The next thing you will notice is that the Categories are back.&nbsp; When WordPress introduced the tagging feature, I jumped all over it and abandoned the categories.&nbsp; It allowed me to do the tag cloud I had on the previous design and made me feel all Web 2.0.&nbsp; When working on this new design though, I realized without categories, I had lost some focus for what I blog about.&nbsp; I decided to look at my content a little harder and found everything could fit into 5 neat buckets, <a href="/web/20131211162734/http://mytungsten.net/category/music/">Music</a>, <a href="/web/20131211162734/http://mytungsten.net/category/personal/">Personal</a>, <a href="/web/20131211162734/http://mytungsten.net/category/pick-of-the-week/">Pick of the Week</a>, <a href="/web/20131211162734/http://mytungsten.net/category/review/">Reviews</a> and <a href="/web/20131211162734/http://mytungsten.net/category/webtech/">Web Technology</a>.&nbsp; I went through the lengthy task of adding a category to each post so now if you only want to follow one type of post on my site, you can use the RSS feed for that category.</p>

<p>This is also a nice lesson for other bloggers, use categories and tags together on your site.&nbsp; Combining few categories with many different tags gives you a well rounded organization for your site and can also help you better define what you want your site to be.&nbsp; I would love to hear opinions of the site, so feel free to comment below.</p>
