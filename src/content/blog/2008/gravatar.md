<p>As you may have noticed after the redesign of my site, in the comments area there is a nifty little icon next to people.&nbsp; This feature is called a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131211125405/http://en.gravatar.com/">Gravatar</a>, and it is my pick of the week.&nbsp; Gravatars allow you to have a common icon on any site that uses that service.&nbsp; It is really easy to sign up for an account and upload your picture.&nbsp; Then each time you make a comment on a site that supports them, it will grab the picture by the email address you use.&nbsp; It is a simple idea, but works really nicely.</p>

<p>Note: If you don’t have a Gravatar, my site automagically generates an icon for you, so you don’t have to see some weird grey figure next to your name.</p>
