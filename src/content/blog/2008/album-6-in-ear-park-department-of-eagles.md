<p>This album has a sound that channels the Beatles, but in a good way. Department of Eagles puts out a robust album that has a variety of different sounds in both the instruments and vocals. Take Teenagers, which has vocals not far distanced from old time radio and compare it to Waves of Rye’s 60′s pysch-pop sound.&nbsp; The thing that moves this album up this list is the consistent quality of tracks with one standout, No One Does It Like You.</p>
