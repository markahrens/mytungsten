<p>Sorry about the delay on the Pick for last week, there was a transition of web hosts that caused DNS delays.&nbsp; That being said, the site is back and ready to go and therefore, ready for a new pick.&nbsp; This week I finally get to pick <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131211105408/http://www.scribefire.com/">ScribeFire</a>, something I had hoped to pick someday.&nbsp; ScribeFire is a Firefox extension that allows you to post to your blog without going to your blog.&nbsp; The biggest thing holding me back from picking it was support for both categories and tags in WordPress, but now both are supported and work great.</p>

<p>ScribeFire also supports working offline with drafts saved locally, posting to a page instead and all the expected blog editor features, but the plus side is that ScribeFire is free.&nbsp; There are a number of other features that I am not using, but might be of interest if you are a hardcore blogger, such as the Monetize feature.</p>
