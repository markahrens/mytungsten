<p>This week I have decided to make a few picks for the iPhone/iPod Touch.&nbsp; I have been avoiding doing these since I didn’t want to bog down the picks of the week with a bunch of apps people might not be able to use.&nbsp; But there are some good apps out there, so I thought I would share some of my picks (all free apps):</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131211165801/http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewSoftware?id=292538570&amp;mt=8">Lux Touch</a> – I love Risk and this is a great 5 minute version where you play computer opponents.&nbsp; The controls are intuitive using touching countries to perform the attacks.</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131211165801/http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewSoftware?id=284942713&amp;mt=8">Instapaper</a> – The biggest issue with reading articles in the iPod Touch is that you have to be in a wifi area to load up the article.&nbsp; Instapaper allows you to save articles to read later from your desktop browser, and then the iPhone app allows you to download it for offline reading.</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131211165801/http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewSoftware?id=284595421&amp;mt=8">Pocketpedia</a> – If you are a fan of the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131211165801/http://www.bruji.com/">Bruji</a> Pedia apps, this is a great addition.&nbsp; You can sync with the desktop versions to get all of your stuff on your mobile device.&nbsp; You can also make collections that live on the device exclusively.</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131211165801/http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewSoftware?id=289446636&amp;mt=8">Trace</a> – A clever game that is kinda like Lemmings, but instead of using tools to work your way though the level, you use your finger to draw a path to walk on.</p>
