Being a web professional, I felt obligated to participate in one of the microblogging formats and even <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131211172915/http://www.marktopia.net/2007/12/07/which-micro-blogging-program-to-use/">posted about which one to choose</a> last December.&nbsp; After tinkering around, I settled on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131211172915/http://www.twitter.com/">Twitter</a>.&nbsp; The problem then came on how to stay up to date with Twitter.&nbsp; I liked <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131211172915/http://iconfactory.com/software/twitterrific">Twitterific</a>, but I was disappointed in having to choose between purchasing the product or dealing with ads.&nbsp; I was then more disappointed in that it kept pinging Twitter and causing problems for me last week.&nbsp; At that point, I hunted around for a different option and found <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131211172915/http://twitterfox.en.softonic.com/">TwitterFox</a>.

TwitterFox is a Firefox extension that provides nearly the same functionality of Twitterific, but in the browser.&nbsp; This actually ends up working nicer because it automatically starts up when I open the browser and I don’t have to have a separate application on my computer.&nbsp; You can paste in your current site using the link button, so if you want to spam Twitter with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131211172915/http://www.thecontentwebring.com/">TCW</a>, it makes it very easy.&nbsp; If you use Twitte, this is a wonderful, free tool to keep up to date on what your friends are doing.

Also, if you want to follow my Twitter feed, you can find it at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131211172915/http://www.twitter.com/mizidymizark">twitter.com/mizidymizark </a>

*Pick of the Week is my way of highlighting cool/new services and software on the web or the Mac. A few Windows applications might sneak in from time to time, but it will be rare. You can find an archive of services and software at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131211172915/http://www.marktopia.net/tag/potw/">http://www.marktopia.net/tag/potw/</a>.*
