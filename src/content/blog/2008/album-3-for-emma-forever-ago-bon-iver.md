I rarely call an album beautiful, but there is no other word to describe this album. If a black &amp; white still photo could be made into an album, I am pretty sure this is what it would sound like. Tracks like Flume, Skinny Love &amp; Creature Fear are great examples of this, but you owe it to yourself to listen to the whole album at a time.&nbsp; It is 40 minutes well spent.
