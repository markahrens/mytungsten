For reasons explained in the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131211172915/http://www.marktopia.net/2008/03/07/lightroom-vs-aperture/">previous post</a>, I have made Lightroom my Pick of the Week.&nbsp; I am not retracting my Aperture pick since it is still a really good program.

*Pick of the Week is my way of highlighting cool/new services and software on the web or the Mac. A few Windows applications might sneak in from time to time, but it will be rare. You can find an archive of services and software at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131211172915/http://www.marktopia.net/tag/potw/">http://www.marktopia.net/tag/potw/</a>.*
