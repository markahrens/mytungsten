<p>This might end up being a false pick in a year, but the concept is cool so I thought I would go with it.&nbsp; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131211125408/http://www.amazon.com/">Amazon</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131211125408/http://www.imdb.com/">IMDB</a> are basically sponsoring a wiki for music, including artists, labels, etc.&nbsp; It is called <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131211125408/http://www.soundunwound.com/">SoundUnwound</a> and allows anyone to edit the site, much like the Wikipedia.&nbsp; The biggest difference is that the changes do have to be approved by the SoundUnwound group before going live.&nbsp; The cool part is that this content will also be used on artist pages on Amazon too.&nbsp; The interface is pretty nice and eventually this could be the source for music information on the web.&nbsp; Only time will tell, but having IMDB and Amazon on board will give it some credibility.</p>
