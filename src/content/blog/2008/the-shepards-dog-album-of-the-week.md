A 2007 album that came in after I posted my top 15, The Shepard’s Dog by Iron &amp; Wine is a fantastic indie folksy album that is perfect for a nice calm evening.&nbsp; It also works well for programming at work or pretty much anything else you might choose to do.&nbsp; The quality of this album is fantastic and the soothing music can only put you in a good mood.&nbsp; If you are not familiar with Iron &amp; Wine, I would recommend checking this out as a first foray into his music.

*Album of the Week is my way of highlighting albums both new and old that I think are worth checking out.&nbsp; You can find an archive of services and software at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131211172915/http://www.marktopia.net/tag/aotw">http://www.marktopia.net/tag/aotw/</a>.&nbsp;*
