<p>This pick will not be for everyone, as it is kind of different.&nbsp; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131211120824/http://www.objectpark.org/FuzzyClock.html">Fuzzy Clock</a> allows you to replace the clock on the menu bar for your Mac with a human readable display.&nbsp; For example, instead of saying 8:25, it would write out twentyfive past eight.&nbsp; It allows you to customize it a bunch of different ways, including different localizations so your clock could be in German if you like.&nbsp; It is free and kind of fun.</p>
