The Smashing Pumpkins are my favorite band.&nbsp; That fact has been true for about 15 years.&nbsp; For the first time since establishing that, I am having a possible change of mind.&nbsp; If you have looked at my <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131211125408/http://www.last.fm/user/mizidymizark">last.fm</a> profile anytime in the last 3 months, you have noticed that a certain band has taken over my listening habits. Death Cab for Cutie may just be my favorite band now. The Pumpkins remain near and dear to my heart, but even I have to admit that their lyrics pale in comparison to Death Cab.&nbsp; And that is really it, Ben Gibbard’s lyrics stand out as clever word play, making basic poetry into elegently sung songs.

Changing a favorite band shouldn’t be this big of a decision, but as someone who has partially defined himself as a Smashing Pumpkins fan to friends, this seems like a deal, if not a big one.&nbsp; I am all for dissenting or supporting opinions, except for maybe Kevin since he is such a big Slipknot fan. And for Kevin, I do enjoy Blink 182 occasionally.
