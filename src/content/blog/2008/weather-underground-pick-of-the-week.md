A day late, but not a dollar short, this week’s pick is appropriate for the winter we have been having.&nbsp; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131211165837/http://www.wunderground.com/">Weather Underground</a> is an online weather service that has tons of information for weather buffs.&nbsp; The basic (i.e. free) service gives you the normal forecast, radar, etc you would expect from a weather site.&nbsp; It also has a fair number of ads, however something like AdBlock Plus should help out with that.

Weather Underground really shines in their pay service.&nbsp; For 10 bucks a year, you get extended radar loops, no ads, severe weather alerts, daily emails, and a favorite cities list.&nbsp; The radar itself is worth the 10 bucks for me since you can zoom in, loop for up to 4 hours and get lightning data.&nbsp; This winter Weather Underground has been invaluable between the alerts and radar for all of the storms we have been receiving.&nbsp; It is also great for the spring and summer as I am able to better track severe storms as they are headed our way.

As a weather fan, this web site has been getting my money for 4 years now and I will happily keep paying for it.&nbsp; If you check out the site and like it, I do have a gift membership I can give out, so feel free to contact me through the comments and we can chat.

*Pick of the Week is my way of highlighting cool/new services and software on the web or the Mac. A few Windows applications might sneak in from time to time, but it will be rare. You can find an archive of services and software at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131211165837/http://www.marktopia.net/tag/potw/">http://www.marktopia.net/tag/potw/</a>.*
