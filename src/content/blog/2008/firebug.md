A belated Pick of the Week, I chose a really useful tool for all sorts of web design and development, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131211125405/http://getfirebug.com/">Firebug</a>.&nbsp; This is really useful to inspect page elements for CSS styles, but really shines when inspecting Javascript errors.&nbsp; You can view the console easily and really debug Javascript problems, something that was very troublesome in the past.&nbsp; If you are doing any sort of web design or development, I highly recommend Firebug, a free extension for Firefox.
