Update: At the time this was published, TotalTunes Control was free.&nbsp; With their latest version, 2.2, they have decided to change it to shareware and charge 8 bucks for it.&nbsp; I will leave it up to you decide if it is worth that or not.

I wanted to fully test this before making it my pick of the week, so that is the reason for the delay.&nbsp; I lucked out because this program best defines the pick of the week in replacing two programs I had been using with one and still being free.&nbsp; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131211172857/http://www.eagle-of-liberty.com/totaltunescontrol/">TotalTunes Control</a> allows you to control iTunes from a smaller interface, but also does much more.&nbsp; TotalTunes Control duplicates the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131211172857/http://www.yousoftware.com/tunes/">YouControl Tunes</a> interface of being able to control iTunes from the menu bar and duplicates the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131211172857/http://build.last.fm/item/160">iScobbler</a> last.fm client to post my songs to last.fm.&nbsp; Add to all this the ability to control iTunes through keyboard shortcuts from whatever program I am in, and you have a fantastic program.

*Pick of the Week is my way of highlighting cool/new services and software on the web or the Mac. A few Windows applications might sneak in from time to time, but it will be rare. You can find an archive of services and software at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131211172857/http://www.marktopia.net/2008/04/04/tag/potw">http://www.marktopia.net/tag/potw/</a>.*
