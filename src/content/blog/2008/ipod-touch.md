So just short of a week ago, I became an iPod touch tester for ITS.  While I admit that I am not upset about this, I have done my fair share of testing for the enterprise apps.  Things that work well include the email and calendar syncing, global address list searching, and overall stability of the device.  I even tested out the remote wipe feature today, sucessfully “bricking” my phone in the instance the device is lost or stolen.  Overall I am really impressed with the new software for the device.  Tomorrow I will post thoughts on some of the third party apps I have installed.
