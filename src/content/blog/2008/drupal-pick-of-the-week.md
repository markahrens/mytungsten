<p>A day late, but this week’s pick of the week is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131211172857/http://www.drupal.org/">Drupal</a>.&nbsp; You might find it odd seeing both WordPress and Drupal as picks of the week, but it is my opinion that they each excel at different things.&nbsp; WordPress does blogs fantastically, Drupal does the same for community sites.&nbsp; Yes you could do a blog in Drupal and a community site in WordPress, but why stretch a product to do something when there is a fantastic alternative out there.</p>

<p>Because of my recent work on a soon to be unveiled HD Music Exchange, I was enamored with Drupal’s flexibility for creating a community site.&nbsp; With any flexibile product, there are a number of ways to do similar things.&nbsp; Luckily Drupal makes it easy to try things out and get to a product that really works well.&nbsp; If you have to build a community web site, I highly recommend looking at Drupal.&nbsp; A note, for now you might want to stick with version 5 instead of 6 because many of the modules have not been ported over yet.</p>

<p>*Pick of the Week is my way of highlighting cool/new services and software on the web or the Mac. A few Windows applications might sneak in from time to time, but it will be rare. You can find an archive of services and software at <a href="/web/20131211172857/http://mytungsten.net/2008/2008/04/04/tag/potw">http://www.marktopia.net/tag/potw/</a>.*</p>
