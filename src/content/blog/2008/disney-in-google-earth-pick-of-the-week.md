Late a few days due to panic over flooding and parents visiting, this will be short and sweet.&nbsp; Google Earth is really cool, and if you are a Disney World fan, it got cooler last week as Disney announced they have rendered the theme parks and most resorts in Google Earth to incredible detail.&nbsp; You can navigate the parks, find out about attractions and just take in the sights of Disney World.&nbsp; More info can be found on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131211162734/http://disneyworld.disney.go.com/wdw/special/flashPages/index?id=GoogleEarthPage&amp;CMP=OTC-3dparksVanity">Disney’s site</a>, but after trying it out for a few minutes, it is really cool.
