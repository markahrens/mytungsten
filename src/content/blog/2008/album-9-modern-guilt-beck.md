<p>In his best album since Mutations, Beck’s new album takes his familar sound and tweaks it a little with the addition of Dangermouse producing the album. The normal funky sounds now have a little beat in the background that makes this album distinctive. Many of these added beats sound out of the 60s, but work well thoughout the album.&nbsp; Some high points include Gamma Ray, Modern Guilt and Volcano, each of which are very different than each other, but sound great on the same album.</p>
