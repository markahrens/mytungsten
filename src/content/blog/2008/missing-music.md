<p>A <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131211105408/http://www.marktopia.net/2008/09/10/playing-favorites/">few posts ago</a>, I mentioned that I might have a new favorite band.&nbsp; This got me thinking about all the music that I have missed. When I started really getting into Death Cab, it was partially because there was a back catalog of albums I could dive into. They were one of those bands that I had heard of, but not checked out until recently. It was definitely one of those “Where the heck was I?” moments. I am curious to hear if other people have that happen to them too. This can include bands you finally you finally checked out after people harping on about them or that you found out about yourself, only to find that they have a cult following. If you have had this same experience, feel free to post them in the comments below.</p>
