<p>Of you iTunes users out there, I am sure many are familiar with the visualizations included with the product.&nbsp; If you like to watch crazy colors zoom around the screen, you will be disappointed with my pick.&nbsp; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131211095312/http://www.iconcertcal.com/">iConcertCal</a> is technically a visualization for iTunes, but when loaded, it scans your music library for artists and produces a calendar of events coming up for them.</p>

<p>You set your start location and the radius for it to look at and it will then return shows those artists are performing at.&nbsp; It will also check for new albums and releases for the artists as well.&nbsp; If you are into music, I highly recommend checking it out.&nbsp; It works on both Mac and Windows iTunes and is free!</p>

<p>*Pick of the Week is my way of highlighting cool/new services and software on the web or the Mac. A few Windows applications might sneak in from time to time, but it will be rare. You can find an archive of services and software at <a href="/web/20131211095312/http://mytungsten.net/2008/tag/potw">http://www.marktopia.net/tag/potw/</a>.*</p>
