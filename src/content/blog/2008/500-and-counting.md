We have a milestone, this is the 500th post for <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">My Tungsten</span> Marktopia.&nbsp; I have spent the last couple of days trying to think of something meaningful or clever to write for it.&nbsp; I realized that those things didn’t happen for about 75% of the previous 499 posts, so why start now.

I will reflect that this blog has gone through many changes technology and design-wise.&nbsp; It started as a Blogger site, then to Movable Type and finally to WordPress.&nbsp; Blogger lasted about 6 months, Movable Type about 6 as well, and WordPress has been going strong for about 4 years now.&nbsp; There was an experiment with Drupal for about 3 months in there, however it was not able to import from WordPress and I could not export from it either, so those have been washed from memory.

I don’t have an exact list of the number of designs the site has gone through, but I would estimate around 30 or so.&nbsp; I like making designs and with some books I have read recently, a new one is in the works again.&nbsp; Every time I make a design, about 3/4 of the way through I start to get new ideas that I cannot implement, but I will say it again, I hope the new design will stick around for awhile.

So almost 5 years after I started, we are at 500.&nbsp; I hope it doesn’t take another 5 to get to 1000, but who knows.&nbsp; For all of you that read this, thanks for your support!
