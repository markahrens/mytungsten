This year’s first contender for album of the year is here by a band called The Helio Sequence.&nbsp; Keep Your Eyes Ahead is a top notch indie album with plenty of variety of songs to keep listeners interested.&nbsp; Personal favorites include Lately and The Captive Mind.&nbsp; The album is a bit short at 37 minutes, but it is a solid release.

*Album of the Week is my way of highlighting albums both new and old that I think are worth checking out.&nbsp; You can find an archive of services and software at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131211165837/http://www.marktopia.net/tag/aotw">http://www.marktopia.net/tag/aotw/</a>.&nbsp; *
