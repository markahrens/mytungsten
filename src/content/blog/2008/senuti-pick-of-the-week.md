A little late on the pick of the week, but I give you the handy-dandy tool for moving music off your iPod to your Mac, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131211172915/http://www.fadingred.org/senuti/">Senuti</a>.&nbsp; Senuti will move tracks into iTunes for you and keep their play counts for those of you interested in that sort of thing.&nbsp; It also is smart enough to know what it has moved in the past and can compare to what exists in iTunes already so it doesn’t copy over stuff you have.&nbsp; This is a great example of a tool that does one thing and does it really well.

*Pick of the Week is my way of highlighting cool/new services and software on the web or the Mac. A few Windows applications might sneak in from time to time, but it will be rare. You can find an archive of services and software at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131211172915/http://www.marktopia.net/tag/potw/">http://www.marktopia.net/tag/potw/</a>.*
