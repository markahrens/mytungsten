<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131211165837/http://www.npr.org/blogs/allsongs/2008/02/desert_island_5_1.html">All Music Considered blog</a> recently had a post asking for submissions about what 5 CDs they would bring if they were stranded on a desert island.&nbsp; I had to read it closely to realize I couldn’t bring a bunch of double albums, it is 5 physical CDs.&nbsp; Here are my five, in no particular order:</p>

<ul>

<li>Smashing Pumpkins – Siamese Dream</li>

<li>Boards of Canada – Music Has the Right to Children</li>

<li>Wilco – Yankee Hotel Foxtrot</li>

<li>Radiohead – OK Computer</li>

<li>Flaming Lips – Yoshimi Battles the Pink Robots</li>

</ul>

<p>I am interested to see what 5 other people would take, so comment away!</p>
