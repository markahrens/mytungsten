One of the big things I have learned over the last year with web design is that a good balance of white space is necessary and adding some texture to your site can really make a difference.&nbsp; For the second of those, I recommend checking out <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131211105408/http://www.patterncooler.com/">PatternCooler.com</a>.&nbsp; They have a bunch of different patterns you can use on your site and can customize the colors in them easily.&nbsp; If you are looking for a sharp background for a web site or even your desktop, PatternCooler has a nice selection.
