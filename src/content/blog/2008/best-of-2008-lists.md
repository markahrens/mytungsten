Well, it must be getting near the end of the year as I have seen my first best of 2008 music list.&nbsp; Amazon got out the door early with their <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131211165801/http://www.amazon.com/b/ref=amb_link_7882162_2?ie=UTF8&amp;node=284005011&amp;pf_rd_m=ATVPDKIKX0DER&amp;pf_rd_s=center-1&amp;pf_rd_r=1VTG3M7JR9T3DTWQSQVF&amp;pf_rd_t=1401&amp;pf_rd_p=463067101&amp;pf_rd_i=1000303401">Best of 2008 Section</a>, including their top 100 albums. I definitely don’t agree with everything on their list (Shearwater at 88??), but it is a start I guess.&nbsp; I look forward to scouting out more lists in the near future and of course, am thinking about my top 10 for the year. With that in mind, if there are more albums you would suggest I check out, please leave a comment.&nbsp; I have also noticed that I don’t have much rap or hip-hop on my list, so if there was any good stuff out there, let me know so I don’t come up with a top 10 indie list instead.
