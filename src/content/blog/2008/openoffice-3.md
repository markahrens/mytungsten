<p>While not as polished as Office 2007 on Windows or Office 2008 on the Mac, OpenOffice does have the whole free thing going for it.&nbsp; It can also open all of the documents that MS Office creates so you don’t need to have Word to open and edit a Word document.&nbsp; It also has some features that are unique, such as the full blown Math application and Database on the Mac side.&nbsp; I wasn’t wowed by OpenOffice, but for free, you could do a lot worse for office applications.</p>
