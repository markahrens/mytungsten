If the previous album was beautiful, this one is haunting. The vocals and lyrics of  Jonathan Meiburg mixed with the instrumentation throughout culminate in something that is striking when first heard.&nbsp; Rooks, the near title track, is one of the more disturbing songs I have heard in awhile telling the tale of a coming plague. Other standout tracks include Century Eyes and The Snow Leopard.&nbsp; It seems like every track uses some sort of strong metaphor which sounds like it could get old, but instead just leads to a powerful album.
