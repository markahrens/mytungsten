<p>Since I did fairly well on resolutions last year, I thought I would give it another try this year.  I will be using the same categories I used last year as well.  Again, I will be adding a few more I am sure in the next couple of days, but here is a start</p>

<h3>Tech (Work or Home)</h3>

<ul>

<li>Finish Help Desk Projects – There are a number of Help Desk web projects in progress right now so getting some done would be great.</li>

<li>Become a SharePoint programming whiz – I have a feeling that SharePoint is going to be more and more popular on campus with some need for custom uses, so becoming better at SP programming will be very useful</li>

<li>Write a blog article each week called “Service/Software of the Week” that highlights a service or piece of software.</li>

</ul>

<h3>Personal Life</h3>

<ul>

<li>Take a Trip Somewhere – Less specific than San Fran trip, but I would like to go somewhere</li>

<li>Finish Painting inside the House – More than halfway there with the first day of the year, just gotta finish up two areas of the house</li>

<li>Put a ceiling fan in the bedroom – I like ceiling fans</li>

<li>Try and fix the backyard – It is a wreck and I would like to get some forward momentum with it</li>

<li>Exercise more – I don’t do much at all now for exercise so I want to start getting in better shape</li>

</ul>

<h3>Social Stuff</h3>

<ul>

<h3>Stuff Stuff</h3>
