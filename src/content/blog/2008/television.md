<p>Catching soccer in the US can be tough if you don’t know where to look.&nbsp; This will hopefully help you out in trying to find it.</p>

<h3>Fox Soccer Channel</h3>

<p>Formerly Fox Sports World, FSC is home to the Premier League, Serie A, MLS, and Argentinan soccer to varying degrees.&nbsp; It will also show national team coverage and occasionally UEFA Cup matches.&nbsp; In addition to matches, there are a variety of news programs covering general soccer news to some of the Asian leagues.&nbsp; This is the place to start to catch soccer in the States.</p>

<h3>GolTV</h3>

<p>While not on as many cable systems, GolTV is a close second to FSC in the amount of soccer shown.&nbsp; It carries both La Liga and Bundesliga matches as well as the Columbian and Guatamalan leagues.&nbsp; Like FSC, it also carries news programs covering the world of soccer.</p>

<h3>ESPN Family</h3>

<p>While not exclusively soccer channels, ESPN does cover it’s fair share of matches.&nbsp; It will be covering the 2008 EURO and has covered the Champions League final rounds live.&nbsp; You have to be a little more aware to catch soccer on ESPN, but most of the time it will be important matches.</p>
