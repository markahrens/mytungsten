<p>*Pick of the Week is my way of highlighting cool/new services and software on the web or the Mac. A few Windows applications might sneak in from time to time, but it will be rare. You can find an archive of services and software at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131211162729/http://www.marktopia.net/tag/potw/">http://www.marktopia.net/tag/potw/</a>.*</p>

<p>This week I share a program that I have been using for awhile now to convert video from one format to another.&nbsp; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131211162729/http://www.techspansion.com/visualhub/">VisualHub</a> is able to take a video in pretty much any format and send it to something else.&nbsp; This includes taking AVI files and sending them to iPod and PSP format, DVDs to AVI or iPod, etc.&nbsp; Just this evening I helped <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131211162729/http://www.urbanfarmgirl.net/">Rebekah</a> convert some old ballet videos so she can watch them on the iPod. When converting to iPod format, it even is able to put it right into iTunes for you.</p>

<p>The other thing it does is allow you to convert any of the video types to Tivo format.&nbsp; It also comes with a plug-in for the TivoToGo program that allows you to move video back to the Tivo.&nbsp; This makes it easy to watch downloaded videos on the Tivo instead of the computer.&nbsp;&nbsp; It even allows you to burn a DVD of videos directly from VisualHub after it converts the files.</p>

<p>While the program is not free (it costs $23.32), it was well worth the price as upgrades are free and they are adding new features fairly regularly.&nbsp; If you ever have to convert video files on the Mac, this is the program to use.</p>
