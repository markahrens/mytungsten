<p>For the Pick of the Week, I am choosing the one podcast I follow as soon as it comes out, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131211162734/http://www.twit.tv/mbw">Macbreak Weekly</a>.&nbsp; Macbreak is where my Pick of the Week started since each host does one on the show.&nbsp; The show itself is entertaining because it not only covers the Mac news of the week, but often sidetracks into other discussions involving productivity, photos or random other technology.&nbsp; Due to the sense of humor of each host and their interactions, it feels like a bunch of tech savvy friends hanging out and talking about Mac stuff.&nbsp; I find it entertaining each week all for no cost.</p>
