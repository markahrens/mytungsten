<p>I asked awhile ago about bands that you were surprised you hadn’t heard before, only to find out they have been making great music for awhile. Now I want to ask, and confess, about music that you don’t have in your collection. I have a large collection of music, but one glaring hole in my library is CCR. For whatever reason, I have not purchased, or aquired through other means, any CCR. I do plan on fixing this soon, but I am curious about other people’s libraries and music that is absent.</p>
