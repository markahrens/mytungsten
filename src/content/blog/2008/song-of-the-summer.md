Every summer there seems to be one song that becomes unexpectedly popular, and is typically a one-hit wonder.&nbsp; For example, in 2006 we had Hey There Delilah.&nbsp; You couldn’t turn on the radio without hearing it that summer.&nbsp; It is a good song, but I bet you can’t stand hearing it.&nbsp; All of those are defining traits for the Song of the Summer.&nbsp; Since it is August already and I have been listening to some radio on our travels over the last three weeks, I spent sometime trying to think what this summer’s song is. After some pondering, I have decided on Time to Pretend by MGMT.&nbsp; Not to say that the rest of their album isn’t decent, but it won’t catch on like Time to Pretend and could prove to be a one-hit wonder.&nbsp; Now I realize my music world is a bit different than others, so feel free to throw out other songs as your Song of the Summer
