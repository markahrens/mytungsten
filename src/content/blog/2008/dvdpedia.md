<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131211120824/http://www.urbanfarmgirl.net/">Rebekah</a> and I have been tossing around a shared movie database where we could keep track of the movies we have, what we have watched, and an easy way to pick a movie to watch.&nbsp; After some planning, it was going to be an elaborate web database project.&nbsp; Thinking that would take a fair amount of time, I investigated a program that might be able to handle this already and stumbled upon <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131211120824/http://www.bruji.com/dvdpedia">DVDPedia</a> from Bruji.&nbsp; For 18 bucks, you get searching and importing data from the web, a customizable interface and smart folders to make that list of romance movies under 90 minutes.&nbsp; As a bonus, Bruji also released a free app for the iPhone called <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131211120824/http://www.bruji.com/pocketpedia/">PocketPedia</a> that does the same stuff and can sync with the desktop application.&nbsp; If you are trying to organize stuff and maxed out the usefulness of the Amazon Media Collection, I would recommend checking this out.</p>
