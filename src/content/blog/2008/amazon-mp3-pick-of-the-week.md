<p>For the first Pick of the Week, I chose <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131211095312/http://www.marktopia.net/2008/01/03/emusiccom-pick-of-the-week/">eMusic</a> and I still recommend it for unique or indie music.&nbsp; However, for music you cannot find on there, I now use the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131211095312/http://www.amazon.com/MP3-Music-Download/b/ref=sa_menu_dmusic1?ie=UTF8&amp;node=163856011&amp;pf_rd_p=328655101&amp;pf_rd_s=left-nav-1&amp;pf_rd_t=101&amp;pf_rd_i=507846&amp;pf_rd_m=ATVPDKIKX0DER&amp;pf_rd_r=08EKCVC7FJV60G49AJ3C">Amazon MP3 service</a> instead of iTunes.&nbsp; Going with the idea that I will want to do whatever I want with purchased music, Amazon MP3s are all DRM free at 256 quality.&nbsp; While iTunes has some music with this same feature set, knowing that I don’t have to check before buying makes it very nice.&nbsp; Another nice feature of the Amazon MP3 is that because it is Amazon, it remembers my purchases and every album helps with recommending new music.</p>

<p>Not all is perfect with Amazon MP3, for example the entirely web based interface leaves something to be desired.&nbsp; You can preview tracks still, but the overall experience isn’t quite as nice as iTunes.&nbsp; However, I am willing to trade off the quality of the experience for the better quality purchase.&nbsp; If you havn’t taken a look at the Amazon MP3 service, I would recommend it.</p>

<p>*Pick of the Week is my way of highlighting cool/new services and software on the web or the Mac. A few Windows applications might sneak in from time to time, but it will be rare. You can find an archive of services and software at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131211095312/http://www.marktopia.net/tag/potw">http://www.marktopia.net/tag/potw/</a>.*</p>
