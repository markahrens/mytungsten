With Valentine’s Day being tomorrow, I thought I would share an album from former Smashing Pumpkins guitarist James Iha.&nbsp; During time between albums for the Pumpkins, Iha put out this solo album which is less “grunge” alternative rock and more lighty, love songs.&nbsp; With track titles such as Be Strong Now, Beauty, Sound of Love and Lover, Lover, it is no real surprise that this is not the harder rock of the Pumpkins.&nbsp; That being said, the album works still and is worth checking out if you are a Pumpkins fan or if you enjoy rock music but want something a little more mellow for Valentine’s Day.

*Album of the Week is my way of highlighting albums both new and old that I think are worth checking out.&nbsp; You can find an archive of services and software at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131211165837/http://www.marktopia.net/tag/aotw">http://www.marktopia.net/tag/aotw/</a>. *
