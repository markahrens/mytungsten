Today I decided to take a break and run down the street to buy an apple from the local food market.  Walking back, I decided to start eating it.  I was getting close to work again and had some apple left, so I sat on a bench outside to enjoy the rest of the apple.  I got back to work invigorated and ready to get going again.  It made me think that with smoke breaks going the way of the dodo, people might not have a good excuse to take a breather during their busy work day.  If more organizations offered free fruit, people could take a fruit break for a nutritious snack and take a rest from their work.  I am looking to organize a committee here to investigate the feasibility of fruit breaks.  I encourage all of you to do the same and we can start a change in the eating and break habits of the American workplace.
