This pick could have been the first Pick of the Week, but I decided to hold it in reserve.&nbsp; I share with you <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131211165837/http://www.adiumx.com/">Adium</a>, the best IM client out there, and it isn’t even close.&nbsp; Built on the same libraries as ~~Gaim~~ <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131211165837/http://www.pidgin.im/">Pidgin</a>, Adium is the Mac port and ends up looking and being many times more polished and enjoyable to use.

First off, it looks like a Mac app, not a Linux app.&nbsp; This by itself would make it better.&nbsp; Then you add on the flexibility of add-ons and themes and this becomes a well supported application with a community of developers making useful additions and attractive themes. Pidgin on the other hand, has no themes available and limited add-ons.

As much as I am knocking Pidgin, it is the best, free multi-IM client on the Windows and Linux side, so that is why I am comparing it to that.&nbsp; I know <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131211165837/http://www.digsby.com/">Digsby</a> is on its way, but without a public beta being available, I won’t include that in the discussion at this time.&nbsp; I would also put Pidgin above <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131211165837/http://www.ceruleanstudios.com/">Trillian</a>, just because you have to pay for the pro version of Trillian to get Jabber/XMPP functionality.&nbsp; So if you followed that, you noticed that the free product on the Mac is better than all of the IM clients on the Windows side, even the ones you pay for.&nbsp; Adium is a program that made me jealous of Mac users before I became one, and I imagine for Windows users, you are feeling the same thing still.

*Pick of the Week is my way of highlighting cool/new services and software on the web or the Mac. A few Windows applications might sneak in from time to time, but it will be rare. You can find an archive of services and software at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131211165837/http://www.marktopia.net/tag/potw/">http://www.marktopia.net/tag/potw/</a>.*
