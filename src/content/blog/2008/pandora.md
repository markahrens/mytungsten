<p>I couldn’t believe I hadn’t made this a pick yet, so I figured I had to throw it out there.&nbsp; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131211120824/http://www.pandora.com/">Pandora</a> is a internet radio service that learns what you like and don’t like in an effort to introduce you to new music.&nbsp; You start off by giving it an artist you like, then plays a song by them.&nbsp; After that first song, it makes a guess about another song you might like.&nbsp; You can then give it a thumbs up or thumbs down to help Pandora learn.&nbsp; This keeps going as long as you like, occasionally going back to songs you marked with a thumbs up.&nbsp; The best part, it is all free, with the limitation that it only is available in the US and UK.&nbsp; If you are a music person and havn’t taken a look at Pandora, give it a whirl.</p>
