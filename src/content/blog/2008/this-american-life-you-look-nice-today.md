<p>Since I am going with podcasts this week, I thought I give you two different options as Picks of the Week.  The first is This American Life, a podcast that takes one topic each week and looks at it from a number of different angles.  It sounds weird, but it is wonderfully hypnotic.  You can find out more about it at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131211125405/http://www.thisamericanlife.org/">their site</a> and it is for free on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131211125405/http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewPodcast?id=201671138">iTunes</a>.</p>

<p>My second pick, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131211125405/http://youlooknicetoday.com/">You Look Nice Today</a>, is completely different and could even be for a different audience.&nbsp; It is a collection of three guys basically doing stream of conciousness discussion about random, odd or even gross topics.&nbsp; That being said, it is hilarious if you are up for bizarre humor, which I am.&nbsp; It is also available for free on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131211125405/http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewPodcast?id=277928864">iTunes</a>.</p>
