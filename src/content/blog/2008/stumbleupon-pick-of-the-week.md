<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131211172915/http://www.stumbleupon.com/">StumbleUpon</a> is a service that I heard about awhile ago, but really got into in the last few weeks.&nbsp; Basically you install a toolbar for your browser and choose the types of sites you like.&nbsp; Then clicking the Stumble! button, you are taken to a random site that has been favorited by other people on the web.&nbsp; You can also add sites you like through the toolbar and keep track of favorites as well.&nbsp; So far I have found a lot of neat new sites through use of the Stumble button.&nbsp; It is also great if you are looking to kill about 5 minutes on a new site.

There is also a social aspect of the service which I have not gotten too into, however if you want to check out my profile it is at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131211172915/http://mizidymizark.stumbleupon.com/">http://mizidymizark.stumbleupon.com/</a>.&nbsp; There you can find sites that I have favorited through the service.

*Pick of the Week is my way of highlighting cool/new services and software on the web or the Mac. A few Windows applications might sneak in from time to time, but it will be rare. You can find an archive of services and software at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131211172915/http://www.marktopia.net/tag/potw/">http://www.marktopia.net/tag/potw/</a>.*
