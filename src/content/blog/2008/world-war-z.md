World War Z is my pick this week in both book and audiobook form.&nbsp; I have been listening to the audiobook which is fantastic.&nbsp; Not only is the book read, they actually got a number of fairly well known actors including Alan Alda to do the different voices of the characters.&nbsp; This adds to the “realism” of the book.&nbsp; The book itself is a history of a war between humans and zombies.&nbsp; While I am not really a zombie fan, this book is more about the human condition after the war.&nbsp; This makes it really compelling to read.&nbsp; The reason I recommend both the audiobook and regular book is that the audiobook is an abridged version, so you can get the whole thing by reading.
