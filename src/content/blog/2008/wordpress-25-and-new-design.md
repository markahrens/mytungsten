<p>I have upgraded to WordPress 2.5.&nbsp; Not too much new stuff for the viewers of this site, but lots of neat stuff on the admin panel.&nbsp; My hopes are now that the work on the admin panel is done, WordPress will turn to the readerâ€™s experience next.&nbsp; To celebrate the new version, I also came up with a new design for the site.&nbsp; There is still a little CSS tinkering to be done, but in general it is ready to go.&nbsp; Take it for a spin and let me know what you think.</p>
