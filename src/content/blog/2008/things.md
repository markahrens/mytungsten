<p>This week I am picking the combo of Things for the Mac and iPhone. If you are looking for a simple but versitile task management tool, Things is fantastic. Both of the versions have the same features so once you get used to one, you are well versed in the other. When you combine that with the wi-fi sync, you can easily keep track of tasks  at both spots. They can be used indepentantly as well but both together is fantastic.the iPhone app is $10 and the desktop version is $40.</p>
