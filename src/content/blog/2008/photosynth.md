I hate to put something that is Windows only as my pick, but <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131211120824/http://www.photosynth.net/">Photosynth</a> is too damn cool to avoid.&nbsp; Microsoft is allowing people to upload pictures of locations and spaces and then using magic technology, creating 3D experiences for them.&nbsp; You do have to have a MS Passport account to sign up, but after you do, you can create your own experiences as well on there using your own photos.&nbsp; It is still buggy at times and requires IE, but it is worth a look just to see what can be done.
