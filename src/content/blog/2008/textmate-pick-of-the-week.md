<p>Lots of people ask me what I use for a web editor, expecting the answer to be Dreamweaver almost everytime.&nbsp; When I tell them I use <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131211162734/http://macromates.com/">Textmate</a>, I get an odd look almost everytime.&nbsp; Textmate is a text editor on steroids.&nbsp; First off, it looks about as good as a text editor can look and if you don’t like the default look, you can tweak it however you like.&nbsp; Next, you can open either a file by itself or a folder using the sidebar.&nbsp; If you open a folder, you can quickly get to different files easily in a tabbed interface.&nbsp; This all makes it easy to get to the files you want to edit.</p>

<p>Luckily, Textmate isn’t just pretty, it is also really useful.&nbsp; It comes with bundles that allow you to perform shortcut macros for whichever language you are programming in.&nbsp; In my case, lots of times that is plain HTML and/or CSS.&nbsp; Textmate can tell by the file what type it is and automatically defaults to the shortcuts for that type.&nbsp; Textmate is one of those programs that seems expensive for what it does, but when you see someone who has mastered the shortcuts, it is like watching a magician put out code.&nbsp; If you have moved past the Design View of Dreamweaver and find the code view lacking, I would recommend checking this out.&nbsp; Also, if you are programming in Rails or PHP, I would HIGHLY recommend giving it a spin.&nbsp; You might find that you can not live with out it.</p>
