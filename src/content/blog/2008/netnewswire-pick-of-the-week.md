<p>*Pick of the Week is my way of highlighting cool/new services and software on the web or the Mac. A few Windows applications might sneak in from time to time, but it will be rare. You can find an archive of services and software at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131211162729/http://www.marktopia.net/tag/potw/">http://www.marktopia.net/tag/potw/</a>.*</p>

<p>Getting in just before the end of the week due to family issues, this week I recommend the newly free <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131211162729/http://www.newsgator.com/Individuals/NetNewsWire/">NetNewsWire</a>.&nbsp; I did comment about NetNewsWire back on the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131211162729/http://www.marktopia.net/2007/09/21/blogging-techniques/">Blogging Techniques post</a> and at that point decided against it because of the $30 price and because of some issues with enclosed content.&nbsp; With version 3.1, that was released this last week, the enclosed content issue was resolved AND it was made free.&nbsp; These reasons by itself would have probably been enough to make it my pick, however some other changes have made it worth while as well.</p>

<p>First off, I have NEVER been one to like browsing web pages from RSS feeds from within my RSS reader.&nbsp; NetNewsWire has changed that by doing a couple of things.&nbsp; First off is a widescreen layout for browsing articles.&nbsp; The second is the way the browser works from within the program.&nbsp; When clicking on an article, NNW does not use tabs but instead provides the different windows down the right side of the reader.&nbsp; It is a nice interface and works well.&nbsp; Now I can take the same “workflow” for reading articles that I used with Google Reader and tabs in Firefox and do it all from within one program.</p>

<p>Another nice feature is the Clippings section.&nbsp; Basically this works like a bookmarks section of your browser, but it allows you to save a headline or actual web page with it.&nbsp; This basically makes it work like the Starred items in Google Reader but also integrates my bookmarks. &nbsp; And if that wasn’t enough, I can post directly to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131211162729/http://del.icio.us/mizidymizark">del.icio.us</a> from there, so you may see more (read any) posts on my account in the near future.</p>

<p>There are also a number of other great features that I am not mentioning here, such as the Combined View, posting to Twitterific, Smart Folders, etc.&nbsp; All of these together make for a great piece of software and now that it is free, you really can’t go wrong.&nbsp; Two last things I will mention are the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131211162729/http://www.newsgator.com/Individuals/NewsGatorOnline/">NewsGatorOnline</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131211162729/http://www.newsgator.com/Individuals/FeedDemon/">FeedDemon</a> for Windows. These are both products put out by NewsGator, the company that makes NetNewsWire, and both are also now free.&nbsp; This makes one of the best Windows readers and the ability to read online and sync clients both free.&nbsp; It is rather impressive to see a company put this software out for free and I can only imagine seeing the usage for all products increasing in the near future.</p>
