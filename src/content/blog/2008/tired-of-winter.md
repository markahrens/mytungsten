It seems you canâ€™t have a conversation here in Iowa City without involving the weather lately.&nbsp; It is understandable as it seems like winter has been kicking our ass since December 1st.&nbsp; So I decided to do some searching to find out how much snow we have received and found that Iowa City has had over 50 inches of snow since December 1st, about 20 in December, 10 in January and over 20 in the first 14 days of February.&nbsp; Now the forecast has us getting 4-8 inches this Sunday.&nbsp; Needless to say, we are all tired of it and look forward to just normal temperatures and no snow.
