thesixtyone was a site that I had seen recommended a number of times, but each time I went to it, I didn’t understand it.&nbsp; Finally after asking a friend who is a member what the deal was, I got it, and I got hooked.&nbsp; The short description is that it is a site that makes a game out of finding new music.&nbsp; With your account, you get points to bump songs.&nbsp; As your bumped songs become more popular, you get more points to bump other songs.&nbsp; You also get extra points for logging in each day and accomplishing goals like listening to 100 different songs.

Being a Web 2.0 site, of course there is the social aspect where you can keep track of how your friends are doing.&nbsp; It also has a wonderful interface which allows you to listen to a track and still browse around other parts of the site.&nbsp; The one drawback for some people is that it is primarily independent artists so you won’t find any top 40 music out there.&nbsp; That being said, I have already found quite a few new artists that are good.&nbsp; You can find my profile at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131211095312/http://www.thesixtyone.com/#/mizidymizark">http://www.thesixtyone.com/#/mizidymizark</a> if you sign up and want to make a quick friend.

*Pick of the Week is my way of highlighting cool/new services and software on the web or the Mac. A few Windows applications might sneak in from time to time, but it will be rare. You can find an archive of services and software at <a href="/web/20131211095312/http://mytungsten.net/2008/2008/05/24/tag/potw">http://www.marktopia.net/tag/potw/</a>.*
