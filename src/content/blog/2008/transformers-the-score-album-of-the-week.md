Due to an unexpected Transformers surge in my life the last week, this album practically begged to be the album of the week.&nbsp; If you like movie scores, you need to get this.&nbsp; As my friend Ben said, it is an <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131211172915/http://www.webarnold.net/archives/118">epic soundtrack</a>.&nbsp; My particular favorite is Arrival to Earth, providing the music for when the Autobots crash into Earth and you get to hear Optimus Prime for the first time.&nbsp; Extremely nerdy, oh yeah, but some damn fine music at the same time.

*Album of the Week is my way of highlighting albums both new and old that I think are worth checking out.&nbsp; You can find an archive of services and software at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131211172915/http://www.marktopia.net/tag/aotw">http://www.marktopia.net/tag/aotw/</a>.&nbsp;*
