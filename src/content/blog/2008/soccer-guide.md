Being a primary member of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131211172857/http://www.thecontentwebring.com/">The Content Webring</a>, I take some ounce of pride in announcing a new content module for my site.&nbsp; Looking at the Non-Blog Content of the site, you will now see <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131211172857/http://www.marktopia.net/an-americans-guide-to-soccer/">An Americanâ€™s Guide to Soccer</a> listed.&nbsp; If you are someone who wants to know more about soccer, as new or longtime fan or just someone who wants to know what the hubbub is all about, I hope you will find this a useful resource.

Right now the introduction is complete, but I plan on rolling out the rest of the sections over the course of the next week.&nbsp; I do not plan on posting here about when each section is complete, but I will post to my <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131211172857/http://twitter.com/mizidymizark">Twitter account</a>, so you can follow that if you want to know when each section is posted.
