<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131211125408/http://www.wordle.net/">Wordle.net</a> is the early pick this week.&nbsp; It is a site that allows you to make text diagrams of word collections that look really cool.&nbsp; Think of it as a tag cloud that makes art.&nbsp; You can paste in your own text and then there are quite a few settings from color to font to how you want the text to be arranged.&nbsp; It then generates your Wordle for you which you can save and share with the world.&nbsp; I took my iTunes collection and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131211125408/http://wordle.net/gallery/wrdl/187752/%CE%BCsik">generated one</a> for the artists weighted by album.&nbsp; A tip if you want to group words together, use a tilde (~) instead of a space as that will act as a space for you.&nbsp; That is how I was able to get band names to stay grouped.&nbsp; If you make one, feel free to post your Wordle in the comments.</p>
