As I mentioned in my 500th post, I am working on a new design.&nbsp; Before going too far though, I wanted to get some thoughts from the people that read the site.&nbsp; Right now I have a single post at a time on the site with links to the last 5 further down.&nbsp; Do people prefer having more posts on the front of the site, is one good or do you read the site through RSS so it doesnâ€™t matter?&nbsp; What about colors?&nbsp; I have a fondness for more natural blues, browns, greens, etc but would a cleaner (read: less color) design work better?&nbsp; Also, because the single post is at the top of the page, do the things like tags and other content get lost or forgotten for you?&nbsp; I am looking for constructive critism so feel free to post any and all suggestions.&nbsp; I realize this is my site, but I also want it to work for you, the reader.
