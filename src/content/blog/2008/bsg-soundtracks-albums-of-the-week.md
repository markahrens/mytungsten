Since Battlestar Gallactica comes back this Friday, I figured the soundtracks to the first three seasons would make a good selection.&nbsp; If you watch the show, you know how impressive the music selection is.&nbsp; If you are not a fan though, you are in for a surprise with the quality of the music for a TV show.&nbsp; It is on par with a theatrical release.&nbsp; If anything, check out the cover of All Along the Watchtower, it is frack’n awesome.

*Album of the Week is my way of highlighting albums both new and old that I think are worth checking out.&nbsp; You can find an archive of services and software at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131211172857/http://www.marktopia.net/tag/aotw">http://www.marktopia.net/tag/aotw/</a>.<br>
