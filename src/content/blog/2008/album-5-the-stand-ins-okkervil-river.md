<p>My revision of 2007 might have given away how I felt about The Stand Ins, considering how this is basically The Stage Names 2.&nbsp; It is a little more up tempo throughout when compared to Stage Names, but it is just as good in overall quality. You get the familiar introspective lyrics, some more depressing than others, such as On Tour with Zykos. But there are the really fantastic songs as well, such as Pop Lie and Lost Coastlines.&nbsp; If you liked last year’s album, you will like this one too.</p>
