<p>Another late pick, but I am going a little unique this time.&nbsp; I havnâ€™t chosen just a standard web site or blog, but <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131211105408/http://www.smashingmagazine.com/">Smashing Magazine</a> is just fantastic. For a web pro, you will get all sorts of articles about design, free items and general web discussion.&nbsp; I have never been disappointed by one of their articles as they are each well written and often are about things I am not very familiar with. And if great articles are not enough, they have a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131211105408/http://www.smashingmagazine.com/smashing-freebies/">great freebies section</a> that collects all sorts of free things for designers.</p>
