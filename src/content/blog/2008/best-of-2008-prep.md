<p>I am sure everyone is anxiously awaiting my Best of 2008 list. I am narrowing down the albums now and am determined to do a top 10 instead of top 15 like last year.&nbsp; One question I did want to ask is if people preferred the day-by-day rollout or would you prefer the full list all at once? Also, would people like a top 10 songs of the year list? Let me know what you think.</p>
