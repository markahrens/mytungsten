<p>One week with the iPod Touch and I feel it is time to share some apps that I have found interesting or useful.&nbsp; All of these are free apps, I have not found an app that I have wanted to actually purchase yet.</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131211125405/http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewSoftware?id=284035177&amp;mt=8">Pandora</a> – For those of you familiar with Pandora, you will love this app because it brings everything Pandora has to offer to your iPod or iPhone.&nbsp; You can listen to any of your stations, thumbs up, thumbs down, etc.&nbsp; If you are not familiar, go to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131211125405/http://www.pandora.com/">pandora.com</a> and check it out.</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131211125405/http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewSoftware?id=284881860&amp;mt=8">NetNewsWire</a> – While not perfect, it does fit well into my news reading workflow.&nbsp; Using the NewsGator service, I can sync what I have read on either the iPod or my Mac.&nbsp; The browsing experience isn’t great on the iPod, but I can save items to the Clippings to read later on my Mac.</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131211125405/http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewSoftware?id=284698706&amp;mt=8">Twittelator</a> – One of 4 or 5 Twitter apps, this is my preferred one.&nbsp; It has no ads and doesn’t try to do a bunch of other things.&nbsp; Simple and works well, that is what I am looking for in a Twitter app.</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131211125405/http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewSoftware?id=284940503&amp;mt=8">Labyrinth LE</a> – The Lite (read: free) edition of Labyrinth.&nbsp; This is a great example of the accelerometer in action as you tilt the device to move the ball around just like you would a real labyrinth board.&nbsp; The physics of the ball are also amazing, making this a great app to show off the abilities of the device.</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131211125405/http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewSoftware?id=284901416&amp;mt=8">Mobile News Network</a> – Basically a pull from the AP of stories nationwide and locally.&nbsp; It has a nice collection of the day in pictures as well.&nbsp; I like this better than the NYTimes app because of it’s simplicity.</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131211125405/http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewSoftware?id=285073074&amp;mt=8">WordPress</a> – The official application to post to a WordPress blog, this has most of the features of the standard web posting.&nbsp; The only thing it is missing is the ability to do rich text editing of posts, meaning you have to know basic HTML to do any linking or whatnot.</p>

<p>I should note all of these are first generation applications.&nbsp; It is pretty impressive to see this much quality stuff initially and it just whets my appetite for bigger and better things to come down the line in the next 6 months or so.</p>
