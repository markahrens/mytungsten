While I don’t think it is quite as dramatic as the author leads it on to be, this match fixing thing is going to get worse before it gets better. The only thing apparently keeping it out of the soccer news, is the fact that racism is so bad in these European countries. Those two things, combined with the USA and Everton performances over the last week, have made for a rough week of soccer for me.
