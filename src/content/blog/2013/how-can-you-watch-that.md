<p>I have heard that phrase a number of times throughout my life. It isn’t from when I watched Kill Bill or something over the top like that. It is when I am watching a random sporting event, football, soccer, basketball,etc, that isn’t involving a team I follow. It might be a Sun Belt football game or a weekday MLS match, but I am still watching, seemingly with no good reason to.</p>

<p>Here is the thing though, while I might not start with a reason to, within 5 minutes, I usually do. I find a reason or reasons to cheer for one team over the other. And the more you watch, the quicker that decision process is. I can tell you, without a doubt, who I will cheer for in the MLS opening weekend after having two seasons of MLS Live under my belt. Same goes for all of D1 and most of  D1-A football teams. It is also one of the things that makes the NCAA tournament so great.</p>

<p>For most sports fans, they will read this and say “well, yeah, duh” but for the non-sports fans out there, this is a little insight into how and why I can sit down and watch La Tech play Utah State and know, I will cheer for La Tech to win.</p>
