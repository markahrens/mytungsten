Yesterday, Google announce [Project Link](https://www.csquared.com), a new project to bring faster data to Africa. I watched the video and read the site, but the interesting thing to me is how I instantly thought “how does this help Google?” Just three years ago, I would have thought this was the coolest project ever, Google using their resources to make the world better. Now, I just think about how Google wants more people online so they can serve ads to them to make more money.
