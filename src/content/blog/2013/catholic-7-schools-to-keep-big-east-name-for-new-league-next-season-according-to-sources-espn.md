This is fascinating to me, just how much power these 7 schools seem to wield in this breakup. They get to keep the Big East name, are going to be stealing Butler and Creighton it seems and are going to be making more per year than the old Big East schools, all without football.

Talk about a terrible decision two years ago not jumping on the 1.2 billion dollar deal ESPN offered. With only three schools left from when that deal was offered, it is a lesson in how to destroy a conference.
