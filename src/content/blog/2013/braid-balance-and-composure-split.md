<p>In the last couple of years, Braid has been doing some really cool stuff, seemingly just because they can. First they got back together and did an awesome EP, then they did a series of shows for their classic Frame &amp; Canvas album and now this split EP with Balance and Composure, bringing more exposure to a current emo band.</p>
