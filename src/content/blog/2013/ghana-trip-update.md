*@TheMarkAhrens Are your loyal MyTungsten readers going to get a recap of your trip? Inquiring minds!*

The short answer to this is, absolutely, though if you have come to this site recently, it is understandable asking the question.

The trip was absolutely amazing and life changing. I took notes each day of the trip and already the group has over 1000 photos shared between us. Some of the highlights include:

* 3 days painting a school
* Delivering supplies to an orphanage and medical clinic
* Going to a rain forest
* Seeing Elmina Castle
* Eating delicious food

I want to do this right, so it is taking some time to gather my thoughts, the right images, etc. I am going to be making a new part of this site for the trip, so once that is ready, I will be sure to share the link.
