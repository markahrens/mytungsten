<p>The MLS season starts this weekend! If you are a soccer fan, you can do much worse than spend 60 bucks for streaming matches all season long. It is a great way to dive into MLS, a much improved league in the last 5 years. And if you donâ€™t live in a city that has a team, it is also a great way to scout the league for the team you want root for, if <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131211105403/http://mytungsten.net/2013/02/how-can-you-watch-that/">you need to for some reason</a>.</p>
