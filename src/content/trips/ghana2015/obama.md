Today was a pretty weird day. We got up early to go to Winneba to pick up our clothes. Unfortunately we didn’t leave early enough as it ended up being a 3 hour drive for something that should only take about an hour or so. There is a notorious part of the road in Kasoa that has nasty traffic and unfortunately, we were right in the middle.

We got our clothes, one of mine was a little short but I can deal. The other one is perfect. The boys shirts were not ready yet though, which was a bummer. When everyone else saw their clothes, they were very excited. Some of the others put in another order, though I am not sure they will get done by Wednesday. We then headed back to Accra for the Kwesi’s brother’s graduation party.

Once we got there, we sat down and chatted a bit, mingled with the family. When the event started, it became pretty clear the MC seemed to have a low opinion of white people. He made a pretty tasteless, in my opinion, Obama joke (it stands for Original Black African Managing America!). He also didn’t seem too keen on us being there either, singling out the group quite a bit. The food was tasty though and the event was nice otherwise. For the first time ever, I can say that the sound system volume was too low at an event in Ghana, though this might be due to the local tradition to be quieter this time of year to not wake the gods.

After the party, we headed back to the hotel for the evening. Pretty quiet day, but it still felt kind of long due to the time in the van.
